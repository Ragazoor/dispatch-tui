# Dispatch

A terminal kanban board that runs Claude Code agents. Each agent gets its own git worktree and tmux window.

## Why

Most agent managers are session managers: they open a terminal and let you watch. Dispatch is a workflow tool.

- **Every agent has a task** — a title, a status, a repo, and often a plan
- **Agents move their own cards** — hooks report start, finish, and blocked; you never set a status by hand
- **Work is isolated** — one worktree and one branch per agent, so your checkout stays clean
- **Agents coordinate** — an MCP server lets them create tasks, read the knowledge base, and chain the next one

## Requirements

| Tool | | Install |
|---|---|---|
| Rust | required | [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs) |
| `tmux` | required | `dnf install tmux` / `brew install tmux` |
| `git` | required | usually already there |
| `claude` | required | [Claude Code CLI](https://claude.ai/code) |
| `gh` | optional | [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com), for pull requests |

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ragazoor/dispatch-tui
cd dispatch-tui
cargo install --path .
dispatch tui
```

That is the whole install. `dispatch tui` starts a tmux session named
`dispatch` for itself if you are not already in one (and attaches to it if it is
already running), then offers to register the MCP server, plugin and tmux
settings before the board draws. It asks first, and it only asks when something
is out of date — so re-running it after an upgrade is how you stay current.

## Your first task

1. Press `n` and fill in a title, a description, and a repo path.
2. Press `Space`. Dispatch cuts a worktree, opens a tmux window, and starts an agent there.
3. Watch it work: `s` splits the screen, board on the left and agent on the right.
4. The agent moves itself to Review when it is done. Type `/wrap-up` in its session to commit and either rebase onto the base branch or open a draft pull request.

In a hurry? Press `D` instead. It skips the form, dispatches at once, and the agent names the task itself.

## How it works

**Columns** — Backlog → Running → Review → Done. `Space` is the one action key: it dispatches a Backlog task, and jumps to or resumes a Running one.

**Worktrees** — each agent works in `<repo>/.worktrees/<id>-<slug>`. Closing the tmux window keeps the worktree, so `Space` resumes where the agent left off.

**Plans** — a markdown file describing what to build. Attach one and the agent implements it directly instead of designing first.

**Tags** — labels such as `bug`, `feature`, `chore`, `research`, `pr-review`. Most are just labels. Two change behaviour: `research` launches a research agent, and `pr-review` skips the design step and, given a PR link, cuts the worktree from that PR's branch.

**Epics** — a group of tasks that run in order. Turn on auto-dispatch (`U`) and finishing one subtask starts the next, so each worktree is cut from a branch that already holds its predecessor's work.

**Knowledge base** — agents record what they learn. Dispatch injects the relevant entries into the next agent's prompt.

**Feeds** — a shell command that pulls work onto the board on a schedule, such as open pull requests or CVE alerts.
