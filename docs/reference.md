# Dispatch Reference

## Key Bindings

### Navigation

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `h` / `l` / `←` / `→` | Move between columns |
| `j` / `k` / `↓` / `↑` | Move between tasks |
| `[` / `gg` | Jump to top of column |
| `]` / `Shift+G` | Jump to bottom of column |
| `Enter` | Toggle detail panel |
| `Tab` | Cycle through feed epics |
| `?` | Toggle help overlay |
| `q` | Quit (or exit epic view) |

### Tasks

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `n` | New task |
| `c` | Copy selected task |
| `e` | Edit task in editor (opens in a separate tmux window) |
| `d` | Dispatch agent — behavior depends on tag (see README) / resume (Running task whose window is gone) |
| `D` | Quick dispatch — pick repo and dispatch immediately |
| `Shift+L` / `Shift+H` | Move task forward / backward |
| `W` | Wrap up — commit and rebase. PR creation is agent-driven (run the `/wrap-up` skill from the agent session) |
| `Space` | Jump to the agent's tmux window |
| `Ctrl+Space` | (tmux global) Jump back from an agent's window to the dispatch TUI — a bare chord, no tmux prefix needed |
| `s` | Toggle split view — side-by-side TUI + agent pane |
| `S` | Swap the selected task into the split pane (in-place) |
| `x` | Archive task (with confirmation); on a Review task, moves it to Done instead (same confirmation as `Shift+L`) |
| `v` | Toggle select |
| `a` | Select all in column |
| `J` / `K` | Reorder task up / down |
| `f` | Filter by repo path |
| `A` | Toggle filter: show only tasks with an active tmux session |
| `N` | Toggle notification panel |
| `:` | Open the main session — jump to it if its tmux window is alive, otherwise pick a directory (reconfigure) and open it there |

### Epics

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `E` | New epic |
| `Space` | Enter epic view (see subtasks) |
| `d` | Dispatch next backlog subtask |
| `D` | Quick dispatch subtask for this epic |
| `Shift+L` / `Shift+H` | Move epic status forward / backward |
| `J` / `K` | Reorder subtasks (determines dispatch order) |
| `q` | Exit epic view |

### Text fields (naming a task, editing a todo, typing a query)

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `←` / `→` | Move the caret one character |
| `Ctrl+←` / `Ctrl+→` | Jump one word (also `Alt+←`/`Alt+→` or `Alt+B`/`Alt+F`) |
| `Home` / `End` | Jump to start / end |
| `Backspace` / `Delete` | Delete the character before / at the caret |

Typing inserts at the caret. In repo-picker fields (`←`/`→` move the text caret;
`↑`/`↓` still move the repo list).

## How Dispatch Works

Press `d` on a Backlog task:

1. Creates a git worktree at `<repo>/.worktrees/<id>-<slug>`
2. Opens a new tmux window in your current session
3. Launches `claude` with the task description and completion instructions (the MCP server is already wired up via `~/.claude.json` from `dispatch setup`)

The agent reports progress via the MCP server running on `localhost:3142`. When it finishes, it moves the task to Review. Closing a tmux window does **not** delete the worktree — press `d` again on a Running task to resume.

## CLI Usage

```bash
# Start the TUI (must be inside a tmux session)
dispatch tui

# CLI — used by agents and hooks
dispatch update <task-id> <status>
dispatch list [--status <status>]
dispatch plan <task-id> <plan-path>
```

Tasks are created via the MCP `create_task` tool — there is no CLI
subcommand for task creation.

## Configuration

| Flag | Env Var | Default |
|------|---------|---------|
| `--db` | `DISPATCH_DB` | `~/.local/share/dispatch/tasks.db` |
| `--port` | `DISPATCH_PORT` | `3142` |

## Feeds

A **feed epic** is an epic with a `feed_command`: dispatch polls the command on
an interval, parses its stdout as a JSON array of feed items, and upserts each
as a task under the epic. The feed is the source of truth — a task whose
`external_id` is absent from the latest emission is removed (manual tasks, which
have no `external_id`, are never touched). Per-epic poll cadence is
`feed_interval_secs`, falling back to the default feed interval (30s) when unset.

Generic feeds come in two flavours, both upstream-agnostic: **flat** (one task
per item under the epic) and **group_by_repo** (items bucketed into per-repo
sub-epics). Author your own script, point an epic's `feed_command` at it, and
debug it with `dispatch verify-feed '<command>'` before wiring it on.

### Managed review & CVE feeds

Two feeds are **managed** by dispatch rather than hand-wired. Instead of
maintaining one epic per review bucket, you configure **two scripts** and
dispatch provisions and reconciles the epic tree for you:

- **Reviews script** (`reviews_feed_command`) — emits **one** deduped list of
  every open PR you're involved with (see the signal vocabulary below). The
  command lives on a managed **`PR Reviews`** parent epic. Dispatch routes that
  single emission into three sub-epics by each PR's signals:
  **My Reviews**, **Team Reviews**, and **Bots**. A PR that changes bucket
  (e.g. you start reviewing a team-requested PR) is **moved**, preserving its
  status, worktree and agent session — it is not deleted and recreated. A PR
  leaves the board only when it is **merged or closed**.
- **CVE script** (`cve_feed_command`) — emits security/CVE advisories onto a
  managed **`CVE`** epic. Advisories are not PRs, so the CVE feed stays a
  separate epic with the ordinary flat upsert.

Each script has an optional interval (`reviews_feed_interval_secs`,
`cve_feed_interval_secs`); unset falls back to the default feed interval.
Reference templates ship in `scripts/` (`fetch-reviews.sh`, `fetch-cve.sh`) with
empty repo/org placeholders — edit them before use.

Managed epics are identified by **role**, not title: rename `My Reviews` to
`My PRs` and the rename survives every reconcile. If you **archive** a managed
epic, dispatch leaves it archived (it is not resurrected); re-enable it by
unarchiving. The three review sub-epics carry **no** `feed_command` of their
own — only the parent is polled, and the parent's single emission fans out to
them.

> **Configuring the scripts.** The four settings are read **at TUI startup** to
> provision the managed tree. There is **no in-app editor yet** — until one
> lands, the settings are set out of band in the dispatch settings store, and a
> restart is needed for a change to take effect.

### Migration: remove old hand-wired review/dependabot epics

The managed reviews feed **folds in** what hand-wired review and Dependabot
feeds used to do (bot-authored PRs now flow into the `Bots` sub-epic). The
generic feed mechanism is untouched, so your old epics keep working — which
means that **until you delete them, the same PR appears twice**: once in your
old review/Dependabot epic and once in the managed sub-epics.

When you enable the managed reviews feed, **delete your old hand-wired review
and Dependabot feed epics.** Dispatch does not auto-delete them (no data-loss
risk), so this cleanup is a manual, one-time step.

### Reviews signal vocabulary (for custom scripts)

If you write your own reviews script, attach a `signals` array to each PR item.
Routing into the My/Team/Bots buckets is done by dispatch from these signals
(first match wins, top to bottom):

| Signal | Emitted when | Routes to |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| `reviewed` / `commented` (and **not** `author-me`) | you reviewed or commented on a PR that isn't yours | **My Reviews** (engagement wins, even over `author-bot`) |
| `author-bot` | the PR author login ends in `[bot]` (Renovate/Dependabot) | **Bots** |
| `direct-request` | `user-review-requested:@me` — you were asked directly | **My Reviews** |
| `team-request` | `review-requested:@me` — your team was asked | **Team Reviews** |
| *(none of the above / empty)* | fallback | **My Reviews** (logged as a warning) |

`author-me` (the PR is yours) suppresses the engagement rule, so your own
commented-on PRs don't count as engagement. A PR matched by several GitHub
searches must appear **once** with its signals **merged** (union), not picked
arbitrarily — group by URL and union the arrays. Unrecognised signal strings
are dropped with a warning rather than failing the whole feed.

> **Known limitation — GitHub search lag.** GitHub's search API is eventually
> consistent: a just-reviewed PR can still match `review-requested:@me` for a
> poll cycle or two. Routing is correct once the signals settle, so a bucket
> move may lag the real-world action briefly. This is expected, not a bug.

## Setup

`dispatch setup` configures Claude Code integration:

1. **MCP server** — registers the dispatch server in `~/.claude.json` (user-global). Earlier dispatch versions wrote to `~/.claude/.mcp.json`, which Claude Code never read; setup now cleans that up.
2. **Plugin** — installs hooks, skills, and commands to `~/.claude/plugins/local/dispatch/`
3. **Tmux** — enables `focus-events` globally (needed for split-view focus indicator)

`~/.claude/settings.json` is not modified by setup — dispatch tool permissions are managed by the user or via Claude Code's interactive prompts.

The setup is idempotent — safe to run on every install or upgrade.

### Plugin contents

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `/wrap-up` skill | Commit, rebase, or author + create a draft PR when a task is complete (PR title and body are written by the agent based on the actual diff) |
| `task-status-hook` | Automatically transitions task status (running/review/needs_input) |
| `task-usage-hook` | Reports token usage per task |

To verify the plugin is installed:
```bash
ls ~/.claude/plugins/local/dispatch/
```

To reinstall:
```bash
dispatch setup
```

## Tmux Configuration

`dispatch setup` enables `focus-events` for the running tmux server. To persist this across tmux server restarts, add to `~/.tmux.conf`:

```
set -g focus-events on
```

This allows the split-view focus indicator to work: a colored border shows which pane has focus (cyan = TUI, dim = agent pane). Without this setting, the border will not respond to pane switches.

## Troubleshooting

**`not running inside a tmux session`**
Start a tmux session first: `tmux new-session -s dev`

**`dispatch: command not found`**
`~/.local/bin` is not in your PATH. Add to your shell profile:
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

**`claude: command not found`**
Install Claude Code from https://claude.ai/code

**Task status not updating automatically**
Verify the dispatch plugin is installed: `ls ~/.claude/plugins/local/dispatch/hooks/hooks.json`. If missing, run `dispatch setup` to reinstall.

**Skills not available (`/wrap-up`)**
The dispatch plugin may not be installed. Run `dispatch setup` to install it.

**Agent window disappeared but task is still Running**
Press `d` on the Running task to reopen a tmux window in the existing worktree and resume the agent.

**`Ctrl+←` / `Ctrl+→` don't jump words in text fields**
Some tmux configs don't forward the modifier on arrow keys unless `xterm-keys` is
on. Either add `set -g xterm-keys on` to your `~/.tmux.conf`, or use the
modifier-free fallbacks `Alt+←`/`Alt+→` or readline-style `Alt+B`/`Alt+F`.

## Learning Store

Dispatch maintains a learning store — approved knowledge that is injected into agent prompts automatically and can be queried or recorded via MCP tools.

### Scopes

Learnings are tagged with a scope that determines which tasks see them:

| Scope     | Covers                        | Example use |
|-----------|-------------------------------|-------------|
| `user`    | All tasks for this user       | Editor preference, personal workflow rules |
| `project` | All tasks in a project        | Project-specific conventions |
| `repo`    | All tasks in a repository     | Build toolchain, test patterns |
| `epic`    | All tasks in an epic          | Shared design decisions for this feature |
| `task`    | One specific task             | Episodic notes scoped to a single agent run |

### Retrieval at Dispatch Time

When an agent is dispatched, Dispatch queries approved learnings that match the task's context and injects them into the prompt. The union includes:

- **Always**: `user`-scoped learnings
- **Always**: `repo`-scoped learnings where `scope_ref` matches the task's repo path
- **Always**: `project`-scoped learnings where `scope_ref` matches the task's project
- **If task belongs to an epic**: `epic`-scoped learnings for that epic

`task`-scoped learnings are **not** auto-injected. They can be retrieved explicitly via `query_learnings` with a `tag_filter`.

### Ranking

Within the injected set, learnings are ordered:

1. **Kind first**: `procedural` learnings appear before all others (injected verbatim as prompt-prefix instructions)
2. **Scope proximity**: epic → repo → project → user (closest context first)
3. **Confirmation count**: more-confirmed learnings rank higher within the same band

The auto-inject cap is **10 learnings**. Agents can retrieve up to **50** via an explicit `query_learnings` call.

### Recording a Learning

Agents propose learnings via `record_learning`. The `scope_ref` is auto-derived from the task's context when omitted:

```
scope=user    → scope_ref: (none)
scope=repo    → scope_ref: task.repo_path
scope=project → scope_ref: task.project_id
scope=epic    → scope_ref: task.epic_id  (error if task has no epic)
scope=task    → scope_ref: task.id
```

All proposed learnings await human approval before appearing in any agent's context.

### Examples

**User preference** — applies to every task you run:
```
scope=user, kind=preference
summary="Always use uv to run Python scripts, never python directly"
```

**Repo convention** — applies to all tasks in this repository:
```
scope=repo, kind=convention
summary="Integration tests use Database::open_in_memory() — never mock the DB layer"
```

**Epic decision** — applies only to tasks in this epic:
```
scope=epic, kind=procedural
summary="This epic adds the learning store; consult docs/specs/core.allium before changing domain types"
```

**Task episodic note** — scoped to a single task, not auto-injected:
```
scope=task, kind=episodic
summary="Rebase on main resolved the rusqlite version conflict; use that if it recurs"
```
