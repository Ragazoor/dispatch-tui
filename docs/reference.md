# Dispatch Reference

## Key Bindings

### Navigation

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `h` / `l` / `←` / `→` | Move between columns |
| `j` / `k` / `↓` / `↑` | Move between tasks |
| `[` / `gg` | Jump to top of column |
| `]` / `Shift+G` | Jump to bottom of column |
| `Enter` | Toggle detail panel |
| `Esc` | Clear the current selection |
| `?` | Toggle help overlay |
| `q` | Quit (or exit epic view) |

### Tasks

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `n` | New task |
| `c` | Copy selected task |
| `e` | Edit task in editor (opens in a separate tmux window) |
| `D` | Quick dispatch — pick repo and dispatch immediately |
| `Shift+L` / `Shift+H` | Move task forward / backward |
| `Space` | Activate the task: jump to the agent's tmux window if one exists, otherwise dispatch (Backlog) or resume (Running/Review/Done with a worktree). On a Running task with no worktree at all (the `⚠ no worktree` card) it opens the kill-and-retry dialog instead. **While split view is active** the jump is replaced by an in-place swap: the selected agent's window is moved into the split pane and the board keeps focus (on the already-pinned task it focuses the pane instead). Windowless cards still dispatch/resume as normal. Replaces the former `d` and `S` keys |
| `Prefix+Space` | (tmux global) Jump back from an agent's window to the dispatch TUI — press your tmux prefix, then Space |
| `Prefix+e` | (tmux global) Show/hide the agent-tree companion pane in whichever agent window you press it in — press your tmux prefix, then `e`. A no-op in windows that aren't agent windows. Like `Prefix+Space`, it is bound while the board TUI runs and unbound when it exits, so the pane can't be toggled with the board closed |
| `s` | Toggle split view — side-by-side TUI + agent pane. With the pane open, `Space` swaps the selected task into it |
| `T` | Detach the tmux panel of every selected task that has a live tmux window (supports batch), after a confirmation |
| `m` | Move the selected task to another epic (or detach it) via the tree picker; on an epic card, reparent that epic |
| `x` | Move task to Done (with confirmation); on a task already in Done, archives it instead. On an epic, always archives. In a multi-selection: tasks only, all Done → archive; otherwise the not-yet-Done tasks move to Done |
| `v` | Toggle select |
| `a` | Select all in column |
| `J` / `K` | Reorder task up / down |
| `/` | Search the board — live bar; a card matches when the query fuzzy-matches its title **or** is a digit prefix of its id (`38` → `#38`, `#380`, `#3837`; a leading `#` is optional). Epic cards match on their own title/id, or when a descendant the board would still show matches. `Enter` keeps the query (shown as a `[/query]` badge), `Esc` in the bar restores the previous query, `Esc` on the board clears it |
| `f` | Filter by repo path |
| `A` | Toggle filter: show only tasks with an active tmux session |
| `F` | Toggle the flat view — in the Running, Review and Done columns, show every task as a plain card instead of grouping subtasks under their epic. Backlog is never flattened: it keeps its epic cards |
| `N` | Toggle notification panel |
| `p` | Open the selected task's URL — its pull request, once one is set — in a browser. Reports `No URL set` when the task has none |
| `P` | Open the personal TODO overlay |
| `t` | Add a TODO linked to the selected card, using the card's title |
| `r` | Refresh a feed epic — the selected epic card if it has a feed command, otherwise the feed epic you are inside. Does nothing elsewhere |
| `z` | Fold the sub-status section the cursor is in — its cards are hidden and its header shows how many, e.g. `── approved (7) ⋯`. Press `z` (or `Space`/`Enter`) on that header to unfold it. Only the Running and Review columns have sections; elsewhere the key does nothing. Folds are remembered across restarts, and a live `/` search shows a folded section's matching cards without clearing the fold |
| `o` | Sync the selected task's repository with origin on its default branch: merge whatever it is behind by, push whatever it is ahead by, after a confirmation. Offered only while the status bar's drift segment is lit (`main ↑3↓1`); a clean or unmeasurable repository shows no segment and the key does nothing. See `docs/specs/repo-sync.allium` |

### Epics

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `E` | New epic |
| `Space` | Enter epic view (see subtasks) |
| `D` | Quick dispatch subtask for this epic |
| `Shift+L` / `Shift+H` | Move epic status forward / backward |
| `J` / `K` | Reorder subtasks (determines dispatch order) |
| `U` | Toggle auto-dispatch for the epic you are inside — chain the next backlog subtask when one finishes |
| `R` | Toggle group-by-repo for the epic you are inside |
| `q` | Exit epic view |

### Text fields (naming a task, editing a todo, typing a query)

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `←` / `→` | Move the caret one character |
| `Ctrl+←` / `Ctrl+→` | Jump one word (also `Alt+←`/`Alt+→` or `Alt+B`/`Alt+F`) |
| `Home` / `End` | Jump to start / end |
| `Backspace` / `Delete` | Delete the character before / at the caret |

Typing inserts at the caret. In repo-picker fields (`←`/`→` move the text caret;
`↑`/`↓` still move the repo list).

### Agent-tree companion pane

Pressed inside the pane itself (no tmux prefix) while it has tmux focus. The pane is
its own process — these keys never reach the board TUI, and all of them act on the
pane's own view only.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `↓` | Move the cursor down |
| `k` / `↑` | Move the cursor up |
| `h` / `←` | Collapse the selected directory, or move to its parent |
| `l` / `→` | Expand the selected directory (a no-op on a file) |
| `gg` | Jump to the first visible row. A two-key chord with **no** timeout, unlike the board's `gg` — a lone `g` waits as long as you like for the second one, and any other key cancels it and then does its own job |
| `G` | Jump to the last visible row |
| `Ctrl+D` / `Ctrl+U` | Move the cursor half a pane-height down / up |
| `Space` / `Enter` | On a directory: toggle it open/closed. On a file: show or hide that file's diff in the pane below. Every badge opens, deleted included — a deleted file's diff is exactly its former contents |
| `a` | Open every changed file's diff at once, or close them all if any are open |
| `q` / `Ctrl+C` | Close the pane |

Each row also carries `+N -M` line counts. A directory shows the sum over the changed
files beneath it, so a collapsed directory says how much is inside. A file git could
not count — one that is untracked, or binary — shows no counts rather than `+0 -0`,
which would read as "nothing changed in there".

### Agent-tree diff pane

Splits the companion pane's column when you open your first diff: the tree keeps the
top third, the diff takes the rest. Your agent's own pane is untouched. It closes when
you close the last diff, and the tree's global toggle takes it away too. Move between
the two panes with tmux's own pane navigation (`Prefix+↑`/`Prefix+↓`).

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `↓`, `k` / `↑` | Scroll one line |
| `Ctrl+D` / `Ctrl+U` | Scroll half a pane-height |
| `gg` / `G` | Jump to the top / bottom |
| `q` / `Ctrl+C` | Close the pane — your open files stay open, and the next toggle in the tree brings it back |

It shows every open file's diff as one document, in the same order as the tree's rows, so scrolling past the
end of one file reaches the top of the next. Lines wider than the pane are cut at its
edge rather than wrapped — the pane is narrow, and one long line would otherwise push
several files off screen. Nothing here can open or close a file: the open set is
decided in the tree and only in the tree.

Three things show a one-line stand-in instead of contents, and each is a fact about the
file: it is untracked, so a diff against the index cannot see it (stage it with `git
add`); git reports it binary; or its diff is over 1 MB.

The cursor position, the manual expansions and the set of open diffs all live in that
process, so none of them survives closing and reopening the pane. Use `Prefix+e` to
toggle it (see above).

When something fails — tmux refuses the split, or git cannot answer — the reason
appears in the pane's bottom border until the next keypress, the whole border turns
red, and it is logged to `app.log`. Your open files are left alone by a failure: what
failed is showing them, and the next toggle retries.

## How Dispatch Works

Press `Space` on a Backlog task:

1. Creates a git worktree at `<repo>/.worktrees/<id>-<slug>`
2. Opens a new tmux window in your current session
3. Launches `claude` with the task description and completion instructions (the MCP server is already wired up via `~/.claude.json` by `dispatch tui`'s startup configuration check)

The agent reports progress via the MCP server running on `localhost:3142`. When it finishes, it moves the task to Review. Closing a tmux window does **not** delete the worktree — press `Space` again on a Running task to resume (or, if the window is still alive, `Space` jumps to it).

## Running & Debugging Locally

```bash
cargo run -- tui                                  # requires a running tmux server
cargo run -- --db /tmp/scratch.db tui             # throwaway DB — never point a dev run at your real one
RUST_LOG=dispatch_tui=debug cargo run -- tui      # then tail the log file (see below)
```

- **A tmux server must already be running.** `dispatch tui` drives tmux for every
  window/pane operation and does no preflight — start a session (or run the TUI
  from inside one) before launching it.
- **DB location**: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/dispatch/tasks.db`, else `~/.local/share/dispatch/tasks.db` (`default_db_path()` in `src/lib.rs`). Override with the global `--db` flag or `DISPATCH_DB`. To reset, delete the file — the schema is rebuilt from `MIGRATIONS` on next open.
- **Logs do not go to stderr.** `cmd_tui` installs a `tracing_subscriber` that appends to `app.log` **next to the database file** (`init_app_log_subscriber` in `src/main.rs`), because stderr belongs to the TUI. Watch it with `tail -f ~/.local/share/dispatch/app.log`. The floor is `INFO`; `RUST_LOG` (crate name `dispatch_tui`) raises it.
- **MCP port**: `DEFAULT_PORT = 3142` (`src/lib.rs`), override with `--port` on `tui`/`setup` or `DISPATCH_PORT`.
- **Exercising MCP by hand**: see `docs/mcp.md`. Identity comes from headers, and **exactly one** of the two must be set (`src/mcp/identity.rs::from_headers`, applied by the `src/mcp/middleware.rs` middleware). A bare `curl` sends neither, so it resolves to `IdentityError::Missing` and any handler that requires authorization rejects it. Send `-H 'X-Caller-Task-Id: <id>'` to act as that task's agent, or `-H 'X-Caller-Kind: session'` to act as the human session; sending both is a `Conflict`.

## CLI Usage

Every subcommand `dispatch` defines (`Commands` in `src/main.rs`). Most exist for
hooks and agents rather than for humans.

```bash
# Board
dispatch tui [--port <port>]                     # start the TUI (starts or attaches a `dispatch` tmux session, then offers to update stale config)

# Tasks — the only task subcommand; creating, listing and updating are MCP-only
dispatch plan <id> <plan-path>                   # attach a plan file to an existing task

# Remove the Claude Code integration (installing it is part of `dispatch tui`)
dispatch uninstall [-y] [--purge]                # --purge also deletes the DB and logs

# Claude Code hook receivers (wired by `dispatch tui`'s config check; not meant to be run by hand).
# Each posts its event to the running board and opens no database of its own; with no board
# reachable on --port the event is dropped and the command fails. See `HookDelivery` in
# docs/specs/agent-health.allium.
dispatch hook <id> <kind> [--kind <notification-kind>] [--port <port>]
dispatch hook-subagent <id> <start|stop|clear> [--agent-id <id>] [--session-id <id>] [--port <port>]
dispatch hook-shell <id> <start|stop> [--shell-id <id>] [--session-id <id>] [--port <port>]
dispatch hook-peer-message <id> --target <session> --body <text> [--port <port>]
dispatch pr-gate <id> [--port <port>]            # PreToolUse gate on the first PR-creation attempt.
                                                 # Also posts to the board; unlike the four above it
                                                 # fails OPEN when no board answers — it never blocks
                                                 # the tool call because a board is down.
dispatch caller-headers                          # headersHelper: always emits X-Caller-Kind: session

# Agent-tree companion pane
dispatch agent-tree <task-id>                    # standalone file-tree renderer for one agent
dispatch agent-diff <task-id>                    # the diff pane below it; split by the tree, not by hand
dispatch toggle-agent-tree-pane <window>         # bound to a tmux key; not for manual use

# statusLine decorator (wired into ~/.claude/dispatch-statusline.json by
# `dispatch tui`'s config check) — records rate-limit windows, then chains to the
# previous statusLine command
dispatch statusline --snapshot <path> [--chain <command>]

# Feeds
dispatch verify-feed '<command>'                 # run a feed command and validate its JSON

# Per-repo settings
dispatch repo set-verify <path> <command>        # set the repo's verify command
dispatch repo clear-verify <path>
dispatch repo list                               # known repo paths + their verify commands
dispatch prune-repo-paths                        # forget repo paths that no longer exist

# Local-first repo sync (see docs/specs/repo-sync.allium)
dispatch repo status [--no-fetch]   # one drift row per saved repo path; read-only
dispatch repo sync [<path>]         # sync one saved repo path, or every one
```

`repo status` fetches before measuring so its counts are current; `--no-fetch`
reports whatever the local refs say. A repository that cannot be measured shows
`unknown` rather than any ahead/behind figure — it is never reported as clean.
`repo sync` attempts every target and exits non-zero if any of them failed.

Tasks are created and mutated via the MCP tools (`create_task`,
`update_task`) — there is no CLI subcommand for creating, listing or
updating a task.

## Configuration

| Flag | Env Var | Default |
|------|---------|---------|
| `--db` | `DISPATCH_DB` | `~/.local/share/dispatch/tasks.db` |
| `--port` | `DISPATCH_PORT` | `3142` |

## Timing Constants

- **Tick interval** (2s): `TICK_INTERVAL` in `src/runtime/mod.rs` — captures tmux output, checks staleness.
- **DB refresh** (event-driven + 10s fallback): `dirty_since_refresh` / `ticks_since_last_refresh` on `App` — `RefreshFromDb` emitted only when a `Persist`/`BatchPatchSubStatus` write has occurred since the last refresh, or every 5 ticks (10 s) as a fallback catch-all.
- **Status TTL** (5s): `STATUS_MESSAGE_TTL` in `src/tui/mod.rs` — transient status bar messages auto-clear.
- **PR poll** (30s): `PR_POLL_INTERVAL` in `src/tui/mod.rs` — polls PR status for tasks in review.
- **Message flash** (30s): `MESSAGE_FLASH_TTL` in `src/tui/mod.rs` — how long a task's card keeps flashing after it sends or receives a native cross-session message (task #4098; warm fill, plus a direction glyph — envelope for received, outgoing arrow for sent, both if it did both). The border is the resting neutral, never hued. Read by *both* `tick_message_flash` (the sweep, `src/tui/update/agent.rs`, which sweeps `AgentTracking::message_flash`/`message_flash_sent`) and the card renderer; they must share it or the map and the screen diverge. See "Message flash" in `docs/specs/core.allium`.
- **Default feed interval** (60s): `DEFAULT_FEED_INTERVAL` in `src/feed/mod.rs` — cadence for a feed epic with no explicit `feed_interval_secs`. Mirrors `config.default_feed_interval` in `docs/specs/core.allium`. Must never fall below the floor below; `the_default_interval_clears_the_floor` asserts it.
- **Minimum feed interval** (60s): `MIN_FEED_INTERVAL_SECS` in `src/models/interval.rs` — the floor under every feed cadence, enforced once in the service (`validate_feed_interval`) and again as a read-side refusal in `FeedRunner`. Mirrors `config.min_feed_interval`; see "Interval literals" in `docs/specs/core.allium` for why it is not in the interval grammar.
- **gg-chord timeout** (150ms): `GG_CHORD_TIMEOUT` in `src/tui/mod.rs` — double-tap window for the `gg` jump-to-top keybinding.
- **Quit split-restore wait** (2s): `QUIT_RESTORE_TIMEOUT` in `src/runtime/mod.rs` — how long shutdown waits for the split-pane restore a quit issued before abandoning it and logging a warning. Mirrors `config.quit_restore_timeout` in `docs/specs/split-pane.allium`. The wait runs before `teardown_tmux_for_tui`, so the board's own tmux tidying cannot interleave with a break-pane moving a live agent.
- **Dispatch watchdog** (840s / 14 min): `DISPATCH_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT` in `src/tui/mod.rs` — force-fails a task stuck in the `dispatching` set (see `docs/specs/dispatch.allium`: `DispatchingTimeout`). Derived as `SUBPROCESS_TIMEOUT` (`src/process.rs`, 120s) times `PROVISION_MAX_SUBPROCESS_CALLS` (`src/dispatch/worktree.rs`, 7) — not a 1:1 mirror — so the watchdog can't trip while `fetch_origin`'s retry budget is still legitimately working within `FetchPolicy::Required` (#4201).

## Feeds

A **feed epic** is an epic with a `feed_command`: dispatch polls the command on
an interval, parses its stdout as a JSON array of feed items, and upserts each
as a task under the epic. The feed is the source of truth — a task whose
`external_id` is absent from the latest emission is removed (manual tasks, which
have no `external_id`, are never touched). Per-epic poll cadence is
`feed_interval_secs`, falling back to the default feed interval (60s) when unset.

**The cadence has a floor of 60 seconds.** A feed command is a shell command on
a timer, so anything faster is a busy loop against your own machine. Every write
path enforces it — the MCP tools, epic creation, and the editor's
`FEED_INTERVAL_SECS` section — and a value below it is rejected with an error
naming the field. The runner also refuses to poll an epic whose stored cadence
is below the floor, warning on each tick rather than quietly clamping. See
"Interval literals" in `docs/specs/core.allium` for why the floor lives in the
service and not in the interval grammar.

Generic feeds come in two flavours, both upstream-agnostic: **flat** (one task
per item under the epic) and **group_by_repo** (items bucketed into per-repo
sub-epics). Author your own script, point an epic's `feed_command` at it, and
debug it with `dispatch verify-feed '<command>'` before wiring it on.

#### Append-only feeds

By default a feed **mirrors** its source: a task whose item is missing from the
latest emission is deleted, and its worktree torn down. That is right for open
PRs and open CVEs, which stay emitted until they close.

It is wrong for a source that emits **events** — a log scan, say. A log record
happens once and is never retracted, so absence from the next emission means
nothing, and a mirroring epic would delete the card on the very next poll after
creating it. Set `feed_append_only` on such an epic and the removal pass never
runs for it:

```
update_epic(epic_id: <id>, feed_append_only: true)
```

Close such a card by **archiving** it, never by deleting it. An archived task
keeps its external id, so the feed matches it on every later poll and creates
nothing — archiving is permanent suppression. A deleted task takes that id with
it, and the next poll inserts the card again.

The flag is not retroactive either way. Turning it off makes the next cycle a
mirroring one, which will remove every accumulated task the current emission
does not name. See `AppendOnlyFeed` in `docs/specs/feeds.allium`.

`scripts/fetch-log-warnings.sh` is the shipped example: it scans a
tracing-formatted log and emits one card per **distinct** WARN/ERROR record,
fingerprinted by module target plus the static head of the message. On a
210k-line log that is 37 cards rather than 106k. Each card defaults to
`wrap_up_mode: "rebase"`.

Like the other templates it ships **inert**, and `dispatch setup` installs it
and its `log-warnings.conf` into `<data_dir>/scripts/` (see "Shipped feed
scripts" below). Edit the INSTALLED conf, never the tracked one — setting
`LOG_FILE` and `REPO_URL` in `scripts/log-warnings.conf` would leave a
permanent local diff on a tracked file. Point the epic's `feed_command` at the
installed script's absolute path. The script sources its conf from its own
directory, so the pair travels together.

### Shipped feed scripts

`dispatch setup` writes two classes of file into `<data_dir>/scripts/`, with
deliberately opposite rules.

**Scripts** — `fetch-dependabot.sh`, `fetch-reviews.sh`, `fetch-cve.sh`,
`fetch-security.sh`, `fetch-log-warnings.sh` — are dispatch-owned. They ship
with empty placeholders, so a copy on disk is expected to stay byte-identical
to what dispatch shipped. Setup records a SHA-256 of each script it writes — or finds already
identical, which is how a deployment predating the manifest heals itself — in
`<data_dir>/scripts/.install-manifest.json`. On the next run:

- A script that still matches its recorded digest is **updated silently** when a
  newer version ships. This is how a fix in this repo reaches a running
  deployment.
- A script that matches neither the shipped content nor its recorded digest has
  **unknown provenance** — you edited it, or it predates the manifest. Setup
  asks before overwriting, defaulting to **No**, and copies the current file to
  `<name>.bak` before it writes. `dispatch setup --yes` never asks and never
  overwrites such a file; it reports it and moves on.

**Config files** — `repos.conf`, `bots.conf`, `org.conf`, `log-warnings.conf` —
are yours. Setup creates them if they are missing and never touches them again.
There is no flag or prompt that overwrites one. They are the entire edit
surface: put your repos, orgs, bot logins and log paths here rather than in the
scripts.

A missing or corrupt manifest is treated as empty and never fails setup. Only
scripts that DIFFER fall back to asking: a missing script is still installed and
an identical one is still adopted.

### Managed review & CVE feeds

Two feeds are **managed** by dispatch rather than hand-wired. Instead of
maintaining one epic per review bucket, you configure **two scripts** and
dispatch provisions and reconciles the epic tree for you:

- **Reviews script** (`reviews_feed_command`) — emits **one** deduped list of
  every open PR you're involved with (see the signal vocabulary below). The
  command lives on a managed **`PR Reviews`** parent epic. Dispatch routes that
  single emission into three sub-epics by each PR's signals:
  **My Reviews**, **Team Reviews**, and **Bots**. A PR that changes bucket
  (e.g. you start reviewing a team-requested PR) is **moved**, preserving its
  status, worktree and agent session — it is not deleted and recreated. A PR
  leaves the board only when it is **merged or closed**.
- **CVE script** (`cve_feed_command`) — emits security/CVE advisories onto a
  managed **`CVE`** epic. Advisories are not PRs, so the CVE feed stays a
  separate epic with the ordinary flat upsert.

Each script has an optional interval (`reviews_feed_interval_secs`,
`cve_feed_interval_secs`); unset falls back to the default feed interval. Both
are bound by the same 60s floor — provisioning copies them onto the managed
epics' `feed_interval_secs`, so they are not a separate kind of cadence.
Both scripts are installed into `<data_dir>/scripts/` by `dispatch setup` (see
"Shipped feed scripts" above). They ship with empty repo/org placeholders and
read their real configuration from the `.conf` files beside them — edit those,
not the scripts.

**Bot logins live in one file, `scripts/bots.conf`.** Both `fetch-reviews.sh`'s
bot-author pass and `fetch-dependabot.sh` read its `BOT_AUTHORS` array, so a
deployment spells its bots once. Use `gh`'s app form (`app/<slug>`); the slug is
deployment-specific, and a repo mid-migration carries PRs from more than one bot
at a time, so list every bot you want on the board. `fetch-dependabot.sh` runs
one `gh pr list` pass per entry and falls back to `app/kognic-renovate` when the
array is absent or empty.

**The app form is enforced, and a bad entry stops the script.** Both readers
validate every `BOT_AUTHORS` entry against `^app/[A-Za-z0-9._-]+$` right after
sourcing `bots.conf`; anything else — `dependabot[bot]` is the natural wrong
guess — names itself on stderr and exits non-zero, emitting nothing. It used to
be misread silently, and the symptom was indistinguishable from "this bot has no
open PRs". A bot running under a plain user account is deliberately not
expressible. See "A malformed BOT_AUTHORS entry is fatal, not silently misread"
in `docs/specs/feed-scripts.allium`.

**PRs you authored never appear** in any of the three review sub-epics. The
runtime drops every emitted item carrying the `author-me` signal before routing
it, so an own-authored PR already on the board is removed on the next poll. This
is enforced in dispatch, not in the script, precisely so it holds for a
`scripts/local/` copy you edited months ago.

**CI status shows as a card label** — `[ci:pass]` green, `[ci:fail]` red,
`[ci:pending]` yellow, and no label at all when the PR has no checks. This one
*does* come from the script (`fetch-reviews.sh` resolves it in a batched
`gh api graphql` call after dedup), so a `scripts/local/` copy predating the
feature keeps working but shows no CI labels until you re-copy the template.

Managed epics are identified by **role**, not title: rename `My Reviews` to
`My PRs` and the rename survives every reconcile. If you **archive** a managed
epic, dispatch leaves it archived (it is not resurrected); re-enable it by
unarchiving. The three review sub-epics carry **no** `feed_command` of their
own — only the parent is polled, and the parent's single emission fans out to
them.

> **Configuring the scripts.** The four settings are read **at TUI startup** to
> provision the managed tree, and are configured **only over MCP** — there is no
> in-app editor. Use the `set_managed_feed_config` tool to write them (each field
> is optional: omit to leave unchanged, pass `null` to clear) and
> `get_managed_feed_config` to read them back. A save re-provisions the managed
> tree immediately, so no restart is needed.

### Migration: remove old hand-wired review/dependabot epics

The managed reviews feed **folds in** what hand-wired review and Dependabot
feeds used to do (bot-authored PRs now flow into the `Bots` sub-epic). The
generic feed mechanism is untouched, so your old epics keep working — which
means that **until you delete them, the same PR appears twice**: once in your
old review/Dependabot epic and once in the managed sub-epics.

When you enable the managed reviews feed, **delete your old hand-wired review
and Dependabot feed epics.** Dispatch does not auto-delete them (no data-loss
risk), so this cleanup is a manual, one-time step.

### Reviews signal vocabulary (for custom scripts)

If you write your own reviews script, attach a `signals` array to each PR item.
Routing into the My/Team/Bots buckets is done by dispatch from these signals
(first match wins, top to bottom):

| Signal | Emitted when | Routes to |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| `reviewed` / `commented` (and **not** `author-me`) | you reviewed or commented on a PR that isn't yours | **My Reviews** (engagement wins, even over `author-bot`) |
| `author-bot` | the PR author login ends in `[bot]` (Renovate/Dependabot) | **Bots** |
| `direct-request` | `user-review-requested:@me` — you were asked directly | **My Reviews** |
| `team-request` | `review-requested:@me` — your team was asked | **Team Reviews** |
| *(none of the above / empty)* | fallback | **My Reviews** (logged as a warning) |

`author-me` (the PR is yours) suppresses the engagement rule, so your own
commented-on PRs don't count as engagement. A PR matched by several GitHub
searches must appear **once** with its signals **merged** (union), not picked
arbitrarily — group by URL and union the arrays. Unrecognised signal strings
are dropped with a warning rather than failing the whole feed.

> **Known limitation — GitHub search lag.** GitHub's search API is eventually
> consistent: a just-reviewed PR can still match `review-requested:@me` for a
> poll cycle or two. Routing is correct once the signals settle, so a bucket
> move may lag the real-world action briefly. This is expected, not a bug.

## External Dependencies

Required on `PATH` at runtime, with **no startup preflight** — nothing checks
binary availability, so a missing binary surfaces as a failed shell command
mid-operation:

- **tmux** (`src/tmux.rs`) — every window/pane operation. Also a **test** dependency: the `tmux_*` integration targets need it (see `docs/testing.md`).
- **git** (`src/git.rs`, `src/dispatch/worktree.rs`, `src/dispatch/finish.rs`) — worktrees, rebase, branch detection.
- **gh** (`src/dispatch/mod.rs`, and the `scripts/fetch-*.sh` feed commands) — PR status and feed data. Network calls.
- **claude** — spawned inside the tmux window by `src/dispatch/agents.rs` as `claude --plugin-dir ~/.claude/plugins/local/dispatch --settings ~/.claude/dispatch-statusline.json …`. Both flags are always present and both are load-bearing: the plugin dir is installed by `dispatch tui`'s startup configuration check, and a **missing settings file aborts `claude` outright**, which is why that same check reports an absent settings file as drift and offers to rewrite it (generated by `src/setup/statusline.rs`; it is never `~/.claude/settings.json`).

The agent launchers read `claude`/`dispatch` from `ProcessRunner::agent_binaries`
(`src/process.rs`) rather than hardcoding them — see "One quoting layer per
launch site" in `docs/conventions.md` before touching a launch site.

That same generated settings file also enables Claude Code's sandbox mode for
every dispatched agent (`sandbox.enabled: true` plus a credential-directory
read-deny list — see `SandboxedAgentExecution` in `docs/specs/dispatch.allium`).
On Linux/WSL2 this needs `bubblewrap` and `socat` on `PATH`
(`sudo dnf install bubblewrap socat` on Fedora); if either is missing, Claude
Code warns and falls back to running unsandboxed rather than failing to start.

## SpacetimeDB

The escape hatch for the shared-store migration: dump, restore and the one-time
seed, all the same snapshot file. Spec: `docs/specs/spacetime-seed.allium`.
Nothing here is on the board's path — `spacetime` is a dependency of these
subcommands only, in the way `gh` is a dependency of PR polling.

```sh
dispatch spacetime dump --out board.json          # this board's SQLite → a snapshot
dispatch spacetime dump-server --out server.json  # the server → a snapshot
dispatch spacetime restore board.json             # a snapshot → the server
```

`restore` takes `--database` (default `dispatch`) and `--server` (default:
whatever the `spacetime` CLI is configured for). It refuses before writing
anything if the snapshot's format version, schema version or table list does not
match, so a refusal means the server is untouched.

The module lives in `spacetime/module/`, outside the cargo workspace — see its
README. `SCHEMA_VERSION` there is the number a restore checks against;
`MODULE_SCHEMA_VERSION` beside it is the module's own shape, which parted
company with the SQLite number in Phase 1.

### Verified behaviour

Checked against SpacetimeDB 2.10.1 on 2026-09-17, on a local `spacetime start`
instance, with the real board (2041 tasks, highest id 4867). The `MemoryStore`
the unit tests run against models the first item below; the rest are why the
code is shaped the way it is. **Recheck these before trusting them against a
newer SpacetimeDB.**

- **An explicit id does not advance the counter.** Seeded tasks 3, 4 and 4096
  into an empty database, then created a task the ordinary way. It got **id 1**.
  This is the whole reason the burn exists.
- **The burn must run BEFORE the rows are loaded.** Burning a table that already
  holds low ids asks the store to generate an id a row already has; the insert
  violates the primary key and the reducer aborts — observed as a fatal 530,
  with the table left unchanged. There is no way to advance the counter past a
  row without generating that row's id.
- **Burn first, and it costs almost nothing.** Burning past 4096 on an empty
  table took 29 ms. It is one insert and one delete per id, inside one reducer
  transaction — the sequence's block pre-allocation does *not* shorten the loop,
  contrary to what the migration design assumed.
- **A second burn costs one id, not zero.** Nothing exposes the counter's value,
  so learning where it stands means generating one. The counter creeps by one
  per restore.
- **Reading and writing use different encodings for an optional.** A query
  returns `[0, value]` for present and `[1, []]` for absent; a reducer argument
  wants `{"some": value}` and `null`, and rejects the bare value outright. Which
  columns are optional is read from the server's own schema — see
  `src/spacetime/cli_store.rs::encode_row_for_reducer`.
- **SQLite booleans need converting.** SQLite stores 0 and 1, the module
  declares `bool`, and the reducer rejects the integer. The declared SQLite
  types are no guide: the same concept is `BOOLEAN` on `tasks.auto_run_plan` and
  `INTEGER` on `tasks.stop_pending` and `todos.done`.
- **SpacetimeDB SQL has no `ORDER BY`.** `SELECT * FROM tasks ORDER BY id` is
  rejected as unsupported, so row ordering happens client-side.
- **An appended column still needs `#[default(CONSTANT)]`.** Appending is the
  only position SpacetimeDB will automigrate into, and appending alone is not
  enough: without the annotation the publish aborts with *"Adding a column X to
  table Y requires a default value annotation"*. Nothing in the Rust source
  hints at it. Found while publishing the Phase 1 module over the Phase 0 one.
- **`--delete-data=never` is what makes a publish an assertion.** Left off, a
  migration the store cannot perform is "resolved" by destroying the database,
  and the publish reports success. `tests/spacetime_module.rs` passes it on
  every publish for exactly that reason.
- **`--root-dir` is not a sandbox flag.** It relocates where the CLI looks for
  its *own binary*, not just the data, so pointing it at a fresh directory makes
  every later invocation fail with `exec failed for .../spacetimedb-cli`.
  Isolate a test instance with `--config-path` plus `start --data-dir` instead.
- **`--delete-data` needs `=`.** It takes an optional value, so `-c never` is
  parsed as the database name and the real name is rejected as an unexpected
  argument. Write `--delete-data=never`.
- **A reducer argument is one `argv` entry**, so Linux caps it at 128 KiB
  (`MAX_ARG_STRLEN`), not at the 2 MB `ARG_MAX`. Batches are chunked by bytes
  rather than by row count: on the real board the median task serialises to
  1.2 KB and the largest to 49 KB.

The end-to-end run: the real board dumped, restored into a fresh instance in
2.9 s with every row count matching, and a task created straight afterwards got
**4868** — one past the highest restored id. Re-dumping the server reproduced
the snapshot exactly.

### Checking a restore by hand

`probe_generated_task_id` is the module's verification reducer: it inserts a
task asking the store for an id, and leaves it there so you can read the id back
out. It is the only way to answer the question that matters — *does the next
task created collide with a restored one?* — because asserting that the burn
loop ran only proves the code calls itself.

```sh
spacetime call -s http://127.0.0.1:3099 -y dispatch-dev probe_generated_task_id
spacetime sql  -s http://127.0.0.1:3099    dispatch-dev "SELECT id, title FROM tasks"
```

The probe row is an ordinary task titled `probe`; delete it when you are done.

### Running an instance locally

```sh
spacetime start --listen-addr 127.0.0.1:3099 &
spacetime publish -p spacetime/module -s http://127.0.0.1:3099 --yes dispatch-dev
spacetime call -s http://127.0.0.1:3099 -y dispatch-dev set_schema_version 97
```

Note the flag placement: `-s` and `-y` belong to the **subcommand**, not to
`spacetime`, and putting them first makes the CLI reject the invocation.

Building the module needs the wasm target
(`sudo dnf install rust-std-static-wasm32-unknown-unknown` on Fedora).

To recapture the wire-format fixtures under `src/spacetime/tests/fixtures/`:

```sh
spacetime sql -s http://127.0.0.1:3099 --format json dispatch-dev \
  "SELECT id, title, worktree, epic_id, phoenix, host FROM tasks" | grep -v UNSTABLE
```

They must contain a row with a **present** optional and one with an absent one,
or the decoder's two arms are not both covered.

## Startup

`dispatch tui` is the only command needed to start dispatch. It does two things
before the board draws — see `docs/specs/startup.allium`.

**1. It obtains a tmux session, and makes sure the board in it is this one.**
Run outside tmux with no `dispatch` session yet, it replaces itself with the
same invocation running inside a session it creates (`tmux new-session -A`). If
that session is already there, it closes the board's window — the one named
`TUI` — starts a fresh board in a new window of that same session, and attaches
you to it. The agent, editor and shell windows beside the board are untouched.
The database path and port you passed are carried through either way.

There is no liveness check: a board that is still running is replaced exactly
like one that exited, because the usual reason to run the command again is a
binary you have since rebuilt. If the board's window was the session's only one,
tmux discards the session with it and the create path applies instead.

Run inside tmux already, it retires any `TUI` window in your current session and
then draws in the window you are in. Two exceptions. The board dispatch itself
just started is already in a window named `TUI` and retires nothing — otherwise
it would close its own window. And run from a pane *inside* the board's own
window, it refuses, because closing that window would close the shell you typed
into.

Four conditions abort before the board draws: no tmux on `PATH`; a tmux that
refuses; a board window that will not close; and a `--port` another process
already holds. A session tmux will not name counts as the second. Everything
else at startup degrades and the board still draws.

**2. It checks Claude Code configuration, and offers to update it.** The check
reads only. When nothing is stale it prints nothing at all. When something is,
it names the stale artefacts and asks once for the whole set; a yes writes them,
a no writes nothing and the board starts anyway. When nothing can answer — a
script, a CI job, stdin redirected from nowhere — it reports the drift and
writes nothing. Nothing in dispatch writes to your configuration directory
except a yes to that prompt.

That check covers the four artefacts below:

1. **MCP server** — registers the dispatch server in `~/.claude.json` (user-global). Earlier dispatch versions wrote to `~/.claude/.mcp.json`, which Claude Code never read; setup now cleans that up.
2. **Plugin** — installs hooks, skills, and commands to `~/.claude/plugins/local/dispatch/`
3. **Status line** — writes `~/.claude/dispatch-statusline.json`, a `--settings` file loaded by every dispatch-spawned Claude session that wires the `dispatch statusline` decorator in as `statusLine.command`, chaining to whatever command was previously configured in `~/.claude/settings.json`. The decorator records the subscription rate-limit windows from the hook payload to `<data_dir>/rate-limits.json` (`~/.local/share/dispatch/rate-limits.json` by default), which the TUI polls to render the budget badge in the top row. A missing or hand-edited copy is reported as drift on the next `dispatch tui`, which offers to rewrite it — see Troubleshooting below.
4. **Tmux** — enables `focus-events` globally (needed for split-view focus indicator)

`~/.claude/settings.json` is not modified — dispatch tool permissions are managed by the user or via Claude Code's interactive prompts.

The update is idempotent, so running `dispatch tui` after an upgrade is how you
stay current: it notices what the new build would write differently and asks.

### Where sandbox config belongs

Both `~/.claude/settings.json` and `~/.claude/dispatch-statusline.json` can carry a `sandbox` key, and it is not arbitrary which one a given setting should go in. `dispatch-statusline.json` is a generated artifact: `write_settings_file` (`src/setup/statusline.rs`) rebuilds its entire contents from a fixed literal every time the startup configuration check applies an update (see Troubleshooting below) — so any key added to it by hand, rather than by dispatch's own code, is silently lost on the next regeneration. `~/.claude/settings.json` is the durable file dispatch never touches. As of `SandboxDisabledForDockerAndUnixSockets` (`docs/specs/dispatch.allium`), `dispatch-statusline.json`'s `sandbox` key is just `{"enabled": false}` — the sandbox is off for every dispatch-spawned session, so there is nothing left dispatch needs to generate config for. Personal or environment-specific sandbox config for a session you run yourself outside of dispatch still belongs in `~/.claude/settings.json`.

### Plugin contents

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `/wrap-up` skill | Commit, rebase, or author + create a draft PR when a task is complete (PR title and body are written by the agent based on the actual diff) |
| `task-status-hook` | Automatically transitions task status (running/review/needs_input) |

To verify the plugin is installed:
```bash
ls ~/.claude/plugins/local/dispatch/
```

To reinstall, start the board — the configuration check notices and offers:
```bash
dispatch tui
```

## Tmux Configuration

The startup configuration check enables `focus-events` for the running tmux server, and adds the line below to `~/.tmux.conf` so it survives a tmux server restart. If you would rather write it yourself:

```
set -g focus-events on
```

This allows the split-view focus indicator to work: a colored border shows which pane has focus (cyan = TUI, dim = agent pane). Without this setting, the border will not respond to pane switches.

## Troubleshooting

**`dispatch tui needs tmux, which is not on PATH`**
Install tmux (`sudo dnf install tmux`, `brew install tmux`) and run `dispatch tui` again. Dispatch starts the session itself; it cannot supply the binary.

**`dispatch: command not found`**
`~/.local/bin` is not in your PATH. Add to your shell profile:
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

**`claude: command not found`**
Install Claude Code from https://claude.ai/code

**Task status not updating automatically**
Verify the dispatch plugin is installed: `ls ~/.claude/plugins/local/dispatch/hooks/hooks.json`. If missing, restart `dispatch tui` — the configuration check reports it as stale and offers to reinstall.

**Skills not available (`/wrap-up`)**
The dispatch plugin may not be installed. Restart `dispatch tui` and accept the configuration update.

**Agents fail to start with `Settings file not found`**
`~/.claude/dispatch-statusline.json` is missing — every dispatch-spawned Claude session is launched with `--settings` pointing at it (see Startup above). Restart `dispatch tui`: the configuration check reports any content differing from what the current build would write — absence included — and rewrites it once you agree.

**Budget badge not showing in the top row**
The status line isn't wired up, or no rate-limit payload has arrived yet. Restart `dispatch tui` and accept the configuration update to (re)write `~/.claude/dispatch-statusline.json`, then start (or restart) a dispatch-spawned Claude session — the badge appears once its statusLine hook has fired at least once. Chain drift (an out-of-band edit to `~/.claude/settings.json`'s `statusLine.command`) and schema drift (an unrecognised hook payload shape) are documented here rather than enforced by a `doctor` check; the next startup check re-discovers the current chain.

**Budget badge shows but is dimmed and never updates**
The badge is reading a snapshot nothing writes any more. Check where the decorator was told to publish — `grep snapshot ~/.claude/dispatch-statusline.json` — and compare it against the path the TUI reads (`<data_dir>/rate-limits.json`). If they differ, restart `dispatch tui` and accept the configuration update. Note that **already-running sessions keep publishing to the old location**: Claude Code reads `statusLine.command` once at session start, so a corrected settings file only takes effect for sessions started afterwards. Until the old sessions exit, the readout stays stale. Older dispatch versions could get into this state on their own, by deriving the location from whichever database the process had open — see `docs/specs/observability.allium`: `SnapshotLocationIsFixedNotDerivedFromTheOpenDatabase`.

**Agent window disappeared but task is still Running**
Press `Space` on the Running task to reopen a tmux window in the existing worktree and resume the agent.

**`Ctrl+←` / `Ctrl+→` don't jump words in text fields**
Some tmux configs don't forward the modifier on arrow keys unless `xterm-keys` is
on. Either add `set -g xterm-keys on` to your `~/.tmux.conf`, or use the
modifier-free fallbacks `Alt+←`/`Alt+→` or readline-style `Alt+B`/`Alt+F`.

### Sandbox (historical)

**Dispatch-spawned sessions no longer run under Claude Code's sandbox** (see
`SandboxDisabledForDockerAndUnixSockets` in `docs/specs/dispatch.allium`), so
none of this applies to a dispatched agent's normal `cargo test` run. It still
applies if you enable Claude Code's sandbox yourself outside of dispatch (e.g.
in your own `~/.claude/settings.json`), or if you're running against a stale
`~/.claude/dispatch-statusline.json` from before that change.

**Under the sandbox, `tmux_*` test targets fail rather than skip.** `tmux` *is*
on `PATH`, so the "tmux not available" skip never fires; the harness starts a
server, the sandbox blocks the unix socket, and every test in the target dies
with `error connecting to /tmp/tmux-<uid>/… (Operation not permitted)`. `cargo
test` then stops at that target — `tests/tmux_diff_pane.rs` is an early one —
leaving the six later targets unrun. That is the sandbox, not your change:
re-run with the sandbox disabled, and add `--no-fail-fast` so one blocked
target can't hide the rest.

**`apply-seccomp: unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER): Invalid argument` is the sandbox, not
your command.** A plain `grep`/`ls`/`cargo` can die with that string and no
output. It names neither the sandbox nor a path, and it fires intermittently
on commands that are otherwise perfectly sandbox-safe — retry, or re-run with
the sandbox disabled, but don't go hunting for what you touched. Redirect
targets need the same care: bare `/tmp` is not writable and `$TMPDIR` isn't
reliably expanded, so `mkdir -p /tmp/claude-1000/<something>` first.

**`git fetch`/`git push` over an SSH remote used to fail under the sandbox**
even with `github.com`/`api.github.com` in `sandbox.network.allowedDomains` —
that allowlist matches HTTP(S) domains, not SSH hosts, so an SSH remote (e.g. a
custom `~/.ssh/config` alias) was blocked regardless. Fixed at the time by
adding `git fetch *`/`git push *` to `sandbox.excludedCommands`; that exception
(along with the one below) is now moot since dispatch-spawned sessions don't
run under the sandbox at all. Still relevant if you enable Claude Code's
sandbox yourself outside of dispatch: a session running against a stale
`~/.claude/dispatch-statusline.json` from before that change still hits a
`socat`/gateway error on `git fetch origin main` and needs the sandbox
disabled to work around it.

**Gradle builds resolving from GCP Artifact Registry (e.g.
`europe-west1-maven.pkg.dev`) used to fail under the sandbox** even for repos
using the `artifactregistry-gradle-plugin` — `*.pkg.dev` wasn't in
`sandbox.network.allowedDomains`, and `~/.config/gcloud` (needed for the
plugin's `gcloud auth print-access-token` call) was in the credential
read-deny list. Fixed at the time by adding `*.pkg.dev` to `allowedDomains`
and removing `~/.config/gcloud` from the deny list; those exceptions are now
moot for the same reason as above. Same stale-`dispatch-statusline.json`
caveat applies if you enable the sandbox yourself outside of dispatch.

## Learning Store

Dispatch maintains a learning store — approved knowledge that is injected into agent prompts automatically and can be queried or recorded via MCP tools.

### Scopes

Learnings are tagged with a scope that determines which tasks see them:

| Scope     | Covers                        | Example use |
|-----------|-------------------------------|-------------|
| `user`    | All tasks for this user       | Editor preference, personal workflow rules |
| `repo`    | All tasks in a repository     | Build toolchain, test patterns |
| `epic`    | All tasks in an epic          | Shared design decisions for this feature |
| `task`    | One specific task             | Episodic notes scoped to a single agent run |

### Retrieval at Dispatch Time

When an agent is dispatched, Dispatch queries approved learnings that match the task's context and injects them into the prompt. The union includes:

- **Always**: `user`-scoped learnings
- **Always**: `repo`-scoped learnings where `scope_ref` matches the task's repo path
- **If task belongs to an epic**: `epic`-scoped learnings for that epic

`task`-scoped learnings are **not** auto-injected. They can be retrieved explicitly via `query_learnings` with a `tag_filter`.

### Ranking

The SQL candidate query orders by kind (`procedural` first), then scope proximity (epic → repo → user), then confirmation count. That selects *which* entries are candidates; the injected block is then **RAG-ranked by relevance to the task**, so `kind` gives no precedence in the final prompt and procedural entries are not injected as a verbatim prompt prefix.

The auto-inject cap is **10 learnings**. Agents can retrieve up to **50** via an explicit `query_learnings` call.

### Recording a Learning

Agents propose learnings via `record_learning`. The `scope_ref` is auto-derived from the task's context when omitted:

```
scope=user    → scope_ref: (none)
scope=repo    → scope_ref: task.repo_path
scope=epic    → scope_ref: task.epic_id  (error if task has no epic)
scope=task    → scope_ref: task.id
```

Recorded learnings are approved on creation and become eligible for injection immediately — there is no
human approval step. Curation happens after the fact: agents rate entries via `rate_learning`, entries
can be removed with `delete_learning`, and the background sweep archives approved-but-unhelpful entries
left untouched past the staleness threshold.

### Examples

**User preference** — applies to every task you run:
```
scope=user, kind=preference
summary="Always use uv to run Python scripts, never python directly"
```

**Repo convention** — applies to all tasks in this repository:
```
scope=repo, kind=convention
summary="Integration tests use Database::open_in_memory() — never mock the DB layer"
```

**Epic decision** — applies only to tasks in this epic:
```
scope=epic, kind=procedural
summary="This epic adds the learning store; consult docs/specs/core.allium before changing domain types"
```

**Task episodic note** — scoped to a single task, not auto-injected:
```
scope=task, kind=episodic
summary="Rebase on main resolved the rusqlite version conflict; use that if it recurs"
```
