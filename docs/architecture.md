# Architecture

Key patterns that aren't obvious from reading the code:

- **Message → Command**: `App::update()` processes input messages and returns `Command`s (side effects). Keep rendering pure, effects in commands.
- **Message routing (co-located)**: see [Message routing](#message-routing-co-located) below.
- **Inline-mutation convention**: Input handlers in `input.rs` directly mutate `self.input.mode`, cursor positions, and other UI-only state, returning `vec![]` (no commands). This is intentional — not an Elm Architecture violation. The rule: if a state change has no side effects (no DB write, no process spawn, no network call), mutate inline and return empty. If it needs a side effect, return a `Command`. If a UI handler in `src/tui/input.rs` returns `vec![]` after mutating `self.input.mode`, cursor positions, or selected indices, that is intentional — do not change it to a `Message`.
- **ProcessRunner trait**: Abstraction over git/tmux shell commands. Tests use `MockProcessRunner` — never shell out in tests. `TaskService::new(db, runner)` takes the runner as a **required** argument so this can't be forgotten; the real runner is only reachable through the explicitly named `TaskService::new_with_real_runner(db)`, used by the CLI paths in `src/main.rs`. (`TaskService` genuinely shells out: `watchers.rs` → `crate::notify::deliver` does a filesystem write plus `tmux::send_keys`.) When a test must supply a runner but expects no commands, pass `MockProcessRunner::unused()` — it panics on the first call, so an accidental shell-out fails loudly. `clock` stays an optional builder by contrast: `SystemClock` only reads the wall clock, so a default costs determinism, never a side effect.
- **TaskPatch builder**: Selective field updates for the database. `None` = don't change, `Some(None)` = set field to NULL.
- **MCP server**: Runs on port 3142 (configurable via `DISPATCH_PORT`). Agents call JSON-RPC methods in `src/mcp/handlers/` to update task status. Caller identity is established via `X-Caller-Task-Id` / `X-Caller-Kind` HTTP headers, parsed by the `extract_caller_identity` middleware (`src/mcp/middleware.rs`) and attached to the request as `Result<CallerIdentity, IdentityError>` — every handler that requires authorization extracts this extension rather than accepting an argument.
- **Integration tests**: Use `Database::open_in_memory()` with a real SQLite instance — no mocking the database layer.
- **Command queue draining**: see [Command queue draining](#command-queue-draining) below.
- **Two full-board refresh paths**: `exec_refresh_from_db` (command queue, inline on the render thread) carries a `get_total_changes` watermark guard because it fires speculatively every 5 ticks; `do_full_board_refresh` (detached, via the `spawn_refresh_*` helpers) has none because it is only reached after something already established that the board moved. The guard reflects *why* the refresh was requested, not the reads — see the doc comments on both functions before unifying them.
- **Editor session invariant**: `TuiRuntime` holds an `editor_session: Arc<Mutex<Option<EditorSession>>>` (`src/runtime/mod.rs`). At most one pop-out editor can be open at a time — the runtime refuses to start a new one while the slot is occupied. The slot is `None` when idle.
- **Layout-cache coherence (self-healing)**: see [Layout-cache coherence](#layout-cache-coherence-self-healing) below.
- **Render dirty flag (fail-open)**: see [Render dirty flag](#render-dirty-flag-fail-open) below.

## Message routing (co-located)

`src/tui/dispatcher.rs` only routes the outer `Message` enum to its per-domain inner enum (`Message::Task(tm) => tm.route(app)`). The per-variant wiring lives **beside each `*Message` enum** in `src/tui/messages/<domain>.rs` as an inherent `route(self, app: &mut App) -> Vec<Command>` method (named `route`, not `dispatch`, to stay grep-distinct from the top-level `dispatcher::dispatch`). This makes `messages/*.rs` deliberately *not* a pure-data layer — each domain enum owns the wiring to `App`'s `handle_*` methods. Adding a TUI interaction is a single-file edit here (variant + its `route` arm) plus the `handle_*` implementation in `src/tui/update/<domain>.rs`; only a brand-new *domain* enum adds a line to `dispatcher.rs`. Every `route` arm delegates to a `handle_*` method (no inline `app.board` mutation, no direct `Command` construction) so the shape is uniform across all domains — see `src/tui/messages/split.rs` for the canonical example. Note the *command* side (`Command` → runtime effect) deliberately stays centralized in `src/runtime/commands.rs` rather than mirroring this co-location: `Command` handlers need `TuiRuntime`, so co-locating a `route` on `Command` would invert the `tui → runtime` dependency. The two routing layers use opposite conventions on purpose.

## Command queue draining

`execute_commands` (`src/runtime/mod.rs`) loads the initial `Vec<Command>` into a `VecDeque` and drains it iteratively. Most `commands::dispatch` arms return `vec![]`; returning additional commands to trigger a cascade is the exception. Any handler that does produce extra commands extends the queue with `queue.extend(extra)`, so a single message can cascade into multiple commands without recursive calls:

```rust
let mut queue = std::collections::VecDeque::from(cmds);
while let Some(command) = queue.pop_front() {
    let extra = commands::dispatch(command, app, rt);
    queue.extend(extra);
}
```

**Draining happens on the render thread's critical path.** `commands::dispatch` takes `&mut App` and holds it across every `.await`, and `execute_commands` is called inline from `run_loop` between the redraw and the next `next_loop_event`. Most of the ~38 `async fn exec_*` handlers await DB work inline (`src/runtime/tasks.rs`), and every mutation serializes through the single writer connection (see the `db_call` section of [conventions](conventions.md)) — so a slow write stalls key handling *and* rendering for its full duration. `MIN_FRAME_INTERVAL` and `frame_ready` are downstream of the drain loop and cannot help. `SLOW_DB_CALL_THRESHOLD` warns at 200ms, which is the signal to look at here.

The *notification-driven* refreshes deliberately avoid this: `spawn_refresh_from_db` / `spawn_refresh_task` / `spawn_refresh_epic` (`src/runtime/tasks.rs`) `tokio::spawn` their reads and feed results back as `Message`s. Moving a long-running `exec_*` handler off the critical path means following that pattern. Do it when you have a measured stall, not speculatively — the cost is that the handler's effect becomes observable a loop iteration later, which the `App` state machine has to tolerate.

## Layout-cache coherence (self-healing)

`App.layout` is a [`LayoutCache`](../src/tui/types.rs) grouping six caches derived from `board.tasks`/`board.epics` — `epic_stats_cache`, `epic_placements_cache`, `children_map_cache`, `column_anchor_cache`, `epic_filter_cache`, `task_index` — plus their fingerprints, so the fields that must stay coherent with each other can only be invalidated as a unit (`LayoutCache::invalidate()`). Handlers that mutate the board should still call `App::invalidate_layout_cache()` (directly or via `sync_board_selection()`) as a perf optimization — it forces an immediate rebuild — but it is **not required for correctness**. `cached_epic_stats()` computes a cheap fingerprint (`compute_layout_fingerprint()`: a plain FNV-1a-style fold over id/status/epic-membership/sort_order/completed_at of every task and epic, plus the folded-section set and the three board-wide filters — repo, only-active, search query — deliberately cheaper than a cryptographic hash; the filters are in there because `epic_filter_cache` and `epic_placements_cache` are both derived through them, so a fingerprint blind to them would let a filter change serve a stale board) on every call, including the cache-hit fast path, and self-heals — discarding and rebuilding the five `HashMap`-backed caches — whenever the fingerprint no longer matches the one captured at the last rebuild. `task_index` (used by `find_task_mut`) uses the same pattern with its own lighter fingerprint, `compute_task_ids_fingerprint()` (task ids only, no epics/status/sort_order — `task_index` only maps id→Vec position), so a same-length wholesale replacement of `board.tasks` with a different id set is caught too, not just length changes. This means a handler that forgets to invalidate can no longer produce silently stale UI on any of the six caches; it only pays for one extra rebuild on the next read.

`epic_placements_cache` is the one field with a second, stricter guard. It answers *which columns an epic's card is drawn in* (`board-layout.allium`, "Epic Card Placement"), so a stale read does not merely misorder a column — it makes cards appear in the wrong ones or vanish. Its `&self` readers cannot call `cached_epic_stats()` to trigger the self-heal, so `App::cached_placements()` checks the fingerprint itself and reports a miss rather than handing back a map built before the last change. Read it through that accessor, never as a bare field.

## Render dirty flag (fail-open)

`App::handle_key()` (`src/tui/input.rs`) unconditionally sets `self.dirty = true` after dispatching a key to its mode-specific handler; the render loop in `src/runtime/mod.rs` only redraws when `frame_ready` sees `dirty && elapsed_since_render >= MIN_FRAME_INTERVAL` (16ms). A prior version tried to skip redraws for true no-ops (e.g. `j` at the last row) by snapshotting a handful of fields — row, column, mode/view discriminant, caret, buffer length — before and after the handler ran, only marking dirty when one of them changed. That opt-in snapshot was fixed for missed handlers three separate times (popup cursor state, tree-view open/collapse state living in a `RefCell`, edit buffers — all invisible to the snapshot) before being replaced outright: any mutating handler that forgot to also call `self.dirty = true` produced a keystroke with no visible effect until an unrelated event (the next keypress, a tick, an MCP notification) happened to trigger a redraw, at which point the missed change and the new one both appeared at once. `Message`/`Mcp` events already set `dirty = true` unconditionally in `apply_loop_event`; `Key` events now follow the same fail-open rule instead of an opt-in one — the 16ms cap already bounds the cost of a redundant redraw, so there is no correctness or perf reason to special-case no-ops.

## Error Handling

The codebase uses three error types at different layers:

- **`anyhow::Result`** — infrastructure and IO errors (file operations, shell commands, DB initialization). Used at the outer edges where errors propagate up to the caller.
- **`ServiceError`** (`Validation` / `NotFound` / `Internal`) — business logic errors in `src/service/mod.rs`. MCP handlers match on these to return appropriate JSON-RPC error codes.
- **Domain-specific errors** (`FinishError` in `src/dispatch/finish.rs`) — operations with distinct failure modes that callers need to handle differently (e.g., rebase conflicts vs. push failures).

Rule of thumb: use `ServiceError` for request validation and business rules, domain-specific errors when callers branch on the variant, and `anyhow` for everything else.

## Quick Dispatch

`Shift+D` creates and immediately dispatches a task without going through the task creation dialog. The flow:

1. The `Shift+D` key handler (`src/tui/input/normal.rs`) emits `TaskMessage::QuickDispatch { repo_path, epic_id }`, whose `route` arm produces `Command::QuickDispatch { draft: TaskDraft { title: DEFAULT_QUICK_TASK_TITLE, repo_path, .. }, epic_id }` (`src/tui/commands/task.rs::QuickDispatch`)
2. Runtime handles it in `exec_quick_dispatch()` (`src/runtime/tasks.rs`) — calls `create_task()` then immediately dispatches
3. The created task gets title `"Quick task"` (`DEFAULT_QUICK_TASK_TITLE` in `src/models/tasks.rs`), no tag, no plan
4. If the board has multiple repo paths, `Shift+D` first enters `InputMode::QuickDispatch` (repo picker), then emits `InputMessage::SelectQuickDispatchRepo(idx)` (`src/tui/messages/input.rs`) to resolve the repo before dispatching

Quick dispatch is the same code path as normal dispatch — the difference is the task is created with defaults and skips the creation dialog entirely.

**Command-level shortcut:** `Command::QuickDispatch` bypasses the normal `Command::DispatchAgent` → `Message::Dispatched` round-trip. `exec_quick_dispatch()` calls `create_task()` and immediately dispatches in a single step — there is no intermediate message back through `app.update()`.
