# Guard against wall-clock dependence in test code. Tests must await a
# deterministic completion signal (oneshot / Notify / an mpsc event such as
# McpEvent) or inject a clock/threshold — never sleep on the wall clock or
# measure it, both of which are flaky on slow CI and needlessly slow. See
# docs/conventions.md ("No `tokio::time::sleep` in tests").
#
# Two checks:
#
#  1. `tokio::time::sleep(` anywhere under src/ or tests/. Production code has
#     no legitimate use for it, so this one is unconditional.
#  2. In *test code* only: `std::thread::sleep(` and `.elapsed()`. Production
#     use of both is legitimate — `src/process.rs` and `src/runtime/mod.rs`
#     sleep, and TTL/interval checks all over the TUI read `.elapsed()`.
#
# "Test code" means a test file — anything under tests/, under a src/**/tests/
# directory, or named tests.rs or *_tests.rs — **or** an inline `#[cfg(test)] mod <name> { …
# }` block inside a production file. Inline modules used to be a documented
# blind spot; they are now tracked by the awk pass below, which opens a region
# at a top-level `#[cfg(test)]` immediately followed by `mod <name> {` (with or
# without a visibility prefix) and closes it at the matching column-0 `}`. A
# `#[cfg(test)]` on anything other than a module (a test-only struct, say) does
# not open a region, and neither does a `#[cfg(test)] mod tests;` file module —
# the file it names is caught by the test-file rule instead. The column-0 rule
# leans on rustfmt: everything inside a module is indented, so the only way to
# close a region early is a multi-line string literal with a line starting at
# column 0 with `}`. That under-reports rather than false-positives.
#
# Escape hatch for check 2: an `allow-test-sleep:` comment on the offending
# line or the line directly above it, carrying a reason. It exists for the one
# shape a grep cannot distinguish from a fixed wall-clock dependence — a poll
# loop that checks a condition against a deadline, where only the failure path
# pays the full wait (see tests/tmux_harness/mod.rs). It is not a way to keep a
# fixed sleep or a timing assertion: if removing the surrounding condition
# check would leave the test still passing, it is a fixed sleep and must go.
#
# The trailing "(" in the sleep patterns and the leading "." in `.elapsed()`
# match call sites only, so doc-comment mentions of the rule and test names
# ending in `_elapsed()` are not flagged.
#
# Behaviour is pinned by scripts/test-check-no-test-sleep.sh.
#
# Run from the repo root. Exits non-zero if any match is found.
