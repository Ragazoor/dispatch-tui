#
# The checker flags backticked snake_case identifiers in agent-facing docs that
# occur nowhere in the code. Task #3806 removed two such phantoms by hand after
# they had survived indefinitely; nothing mechanical could catch them.
#
# The assertions below pin the decisions that make the check trustworthy rather
# than noisy:
#   - the identifier index is built from CODE ONLY, comments stripped. A first
#     prototype indexed raw file text, so every phantom self-validated via its
#     own doc comment. That regression has its own case below.
#   - `tests/` counts as code (docs cite test helpers like `poll_for`).
#   - Allium spec bodies count as an index source (specs declare their own
#     namespace: enum variants, spec-level pseudocode).
#   - matching is whole-word and strict; no substring fallback.
#
# Hermetic: every assertion runs against a temp fixture repo. Validating this
# repo's own docs is check-doc-symbols.sh's own job, run as its own hook step.
#
# Run from the repo root:  bash scripts/test-check-doc-symbols.sh
# Exits 0 on success, non-zero with a diagnostic on the first failed assertion.
