# Scan a tracing-formatted log file and emit one FeedItem per DISTINCT
# WARN/ERROR record, for use as a dispatch feed epic command.
#
# Requirements: jq, awk
#
# Usage:
#   dispatch verify-feed scripts/fetch-log-warnings.sh   # validate output
#
# THIS FEED'S EPIC MUST BE APPEND-ONLY. A log record is an EVENT: it happens
# once, and nothing upstream ever retracts it, so its absence from a later
# emission means nothing at all. An ordinary feed epic reads absence as
# "closed" and would delete the task — and tear down its worktree — on the very
# next poll. Set the flag once, when you wire the epic up:
#
#   update_epic(epic_id: <id>, feed_append_only: true)
#
# See docs/specs/feeds.allium: AppendOnlyFeed.
#
# HOW A CARD IS CLOSED. Three outcomes, all three permanent:
#
#   1. A real bug         -> fix it.
#   2. A false positive   -> the code is right and the LOG LINE is wrong.
#                            DEMOTE it to INFO/DEBUG: the record stops being
#                            emitted and the log's WARN level gets more honest.
#                            Rewording instead is NOT terminal — the message
#                            head is the card's identity, so a reworded line
#                            arrives as a new card to confirm and archive once.
#   3. Real but transient -> upstream flakiness you still want logged.
#                            ARCHIVE the card.
#
# Archive, never delete. An archived task keeps its external id, so the feed
# matches it on every later poll and creates nothing. A DELETED task takes that
# id with it, and the next poll inserts the card all over again.
#
# Every item is emitted with wrap_up_mode "rebase", because all three outcomes
# above land on the repo the log came from. See docs/specs/feed-scripts.allium.
#
# Note: when used as a dispatch feed_command, use the absolute path to this
# script. Relative paths only work if dispatch is launched from the project root.
#
# Note: the feed owns `description` and rewrites it on every poll — that is how
# the occurrence count stays current while you work. Do not keep triage notes
# there; they will be overwritten. Use the task's plan.

# Configuration: edit log-warnings.conf in the same directory (SSOT), or set
# these directly below as a fallback when that file is not present.
#
# CONFIGURE A COPY, NOT THE TRACKED FILE. Copy this script and its conf next to
# your other live feed scripts (<data_dir>/scripts/, alongside repos.conf) and
# edit the copy — editing the tracked pair in the repo leaves a permanent local
# diff. The conf is sourced from whatever directory the script itself is in, so
# the two travel together.
#
#   LOG_FILE  absolute path to the log to scan. Empty = this script is inert.
#   REPO_URL  GitHub root URL of the repo the log belongs to. Dispatch resolves
#             it to a local clone so the created task can be dispatched into a
#             worktree. A log record carries no URL of its own; resolving a
#             repo is the only reason this field is set.
#   LEVELS    which severities become cards, as an ERE alternation.
#   SAMPLES   how many raw lines to quote in the description.

# WHAT MAKES TWO LINES THE SAME PROBLEM.
#
# Not the raw line: every line differs by timestamp, and a real log holds
# six-figure counts of a handful of distinct problems. Each record is
# fingerprinted as its emitting MODULE TARGET plus the STATIC HEAD of its
# message — everything up to the first ":" or the first " key=", which is where
# tracing's literal format string stops and the interpolated detail begins.
#
# That is a proxy for the CALL SITE. A file:line would be exact, but it moves
# on every refactor, and a moved fingerprint means a card you already triaged
# and archived comes back as new. The static head survives refactoring.
#
# Two normalisations inside the head, because a message can interpolate before
# it reaches a colon: digit runs collapse to N, and org/repo pairs to R.
#
# Pointing this at a different repo's logs means editing this awk block. The
# format it parses is tracing's; the fingerprint recipe is policy, and policy
# belongs in the script rather than in the dispatch runtime.
# AGGREGATE IN AWK, NOT IN JQ. awk emits one row PER GROUP, not per line, so
# everything downstream is proportional to the number of distinct records
# rather than to the size of the log. That matters: handing jq one object per
# matched line peaked at 1.6 GB of resident memory on a 335 MB log, because
# 72% of the bytes were sample text for lines that were never quoted. This
# shape holds flat at a few MB on the same input, and the full re-scan — which
# is what makes archive-as-suppression work — is kept.
