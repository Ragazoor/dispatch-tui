#!/usr/bin/env bash
# fetch-reviews.sh — outputs every open PR you are involved with as a single,
# deduped FeedItem JSON array, for use as a dispatch feed_command.
#
# Prerequisites: gh CLI (https://cli.github.com/) and jq must be in PATH.
#
# Setup:
#   1. Copy this file to scripts/local/fetch-reviews.sh
#   2. Edit repos.conf in the same directory (the REPOS array) to list the
#      "owner/repo" slugs you want review-related PR activity for. This is
#      the same SSOT fetch-cve.sh reads, so reviews and CVEs stay scoped to
#      one repo list. Feeds My/Team/Bots exactly as before.
#   3. Optionally edit org.conf in the same directory (the ORGS array) to
#      list GitHub org slugs you want review activity for. This is a
#      SEPARATE scope: it re-runs three of the four review-related queries
#      (excluding the team-inclusive review-requested:@me — see below)
#      against whole orgs instead of the repo list, and every match routes
#      to My Reviews only (it never widens Team Reviews or Bots).
#   4. Point the parent "Reviews" epic's feed_command at the local copy.
#      There is NO scope argument — the dispatch role router (feed_role =
#      reviews_parent) splits the single emission into My / Team / Bots
#      sub-epics using the per-PR `signals` this script attaches.
#
# What it emits:
#   ONE FeedItem array covering the union of these open-PR searches, each PR
#   tagged with the signal(s) that matched it:
#     - review-requested:@me        -> signal "team-request" (direct + team)
#     - user-review-requested:@me   -> signal "direct-request" (direct only)
#     - reviewed-by:@me             -> signal "reviewed"
#     - commenter:@me -author:@me   -> signal "commented" (excludes your own PRs)
#   These four are scoped by repos.conf's REPOS list. THREE of the four are
#   run again, scoped by org.conf's ORGS list instead, and every match from
#   that pass carries a single shared signal so it always lands in My
#   Reviews:
#     - user-review-requested:@me | reviewed-by:@me |
#       commenter:@me -author:@me   (per org)  -> signal "org-review"
#   review-requested:@me is deliberately excluded from the org-scoped pass:
#   it also matches PRs requested from a team you belong to (not just you
#   personally), which org-wide would sweep in team-request noise.
#
#   A fifth pass covers bot-authored PRs you have NO review involvement with,
#   which the four review queries above can never reach:
#     - author:<bot>              (per bot in bots.conf, per repo in
#                                  repos.conf) -> signal "author-bot"
#   Bot logins go in bots.conf (the BOT_AUTHORS array) because they are
#   deployment-specific: a self-hosted Renovate app is named after the org
#   that installed it (e.g. app/kognic-renovate, not app/renovate). Absent or
#   empty BOT_AUTHORS skips the pass. It emits "author-bot" rather than a new
#   signal because dispatch's router already maps {author-bot} to Bots, and a
#   bot PR you HAVE reviewed still merges to one item and stays in My Reviews
#   (engagement wins over the bot rule). Repo-scoped only — org-wide bot
#   authorship would sweep in every dependency PR in the org.
#
#   Plus per-PR author signals: "author-bot" when the author login ends in
#   "[bot]" (Renovate/Dependabot), "author-me" when the author is the gh user.
#
#   A FINAL pass, after dedup, attaches each PR's CI status as a label:
#     - "ci:pass"    the head commit's check rollup succeeded
#     - "ci:fail"    the rollup failed or errored
#     - "ci:pending" the rollup is running, or expected but not started
#   A PR with NO checks gets NO ci label: absence means "nothing ran", which is
#   distinct from all three and must not be collapsed into "pass". `gh search
#   prs --json` exposes no check field at all, so this is a separate request —
#   ONE batched `gh api graphql` per poll over every deduped PR, not one call
#   per PR. A failed fetch degrades to no ci label, never a wrong one, and
#   never fails the emission.
#
#   A PR matched by several searches appears ONCE, with its signals merged
#   (unioned) — the dedup groups by URL and unions the signal arrays.
#
#   Bot-authored PRs are INCLUDED (Renovate/Dependabot are no longer excluded);
#   they get tag "dependabot". Human-review PRs get tag "pr-review". Draft
#   PRs are INCLUDED, with a "draft" label appended so the TUI card shows it.
#
# Output format (FeedItem):
#   [{"external_id":"review:org/repo#42","title":"#42 PR title","description":"...","url":"...","status":"backlog","tag":"pr-review","labels":["@author","repo","ci:pass"],"signals":["team-request","reviewed"]}]
#
# Routing is handled by dispatch, not here. The signal vocabulary is the wire
# contract with the role router (see docs/specs/feeds.allium, enum Signal).
