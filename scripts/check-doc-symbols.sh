# Verify every symbol citation in our agent-facing docs still names something
# that occurs in the code. Sibling to check-doc-paths.sh, which validates paths
# and `file:NN` citations but never symbol names — the gap that let two phantom
# function names survive until #3806 removed them by hand.
#
# Five candidate shapes are checked (see the regexes below): backticked
# snake_case spans, `path.rs::symbol` citations, `Type::method` citations,
# long bare snake_case names, and `<spec>.allium's Block` cross-spec citations.
# #4097 added the middle three after #3989 and #4091 each lost a spec citation
# to rot that the backtick-only scan could not see — a deleted test still named
# in a `@guidance` block, a deleted `FeedJob` type, and a spec-first
# `run_feed_cycle` that the code never defined. #4539 added the last after
# agent-health.allium was found citing agent-tree.allium's
# AgentFileToolCompleted three months after that trigger was deleted.
#
# This is mostly a PHANTOM check, not a definition check. It does not ask "is
# this a function"; it asks "does this identifier occur in the code at all".
# Matching against `fn <name>` definitions drowns in false positives (struct
# fields, enum variants, config keys, test helpers); the phantom check measured
# 0 false positives on .allium and 2 on the markdown docs. The tradeoff is a
# false negative: a renamed symbol whose old name still occurs somewhere in the
# code passes.
#
# The `path.rs::symbol` shape is the exception, and is checked more strictly:
# every segment must occur in the CITED FILE. A symbol that exists in some other
# file is still a wrong citation, and being spec-first makes that systematic
# rather than accidental — the citation is authored before the symbol exists.
#
# `<spec>.allium's Block` is checked the same way, against the spec it names.
# Bare PascalCase is unscannable (see the exclusion below) because a name alone
# says nothing about where it should live; a name qualified by its own file
# says exactly that, which is what makes this shape checkable when the bare one
# is not. Comments in the cited spec are NOT stripped: Allium names things in
# `--` prose as well as in declarations (tasks.allium's TaskTeardown,
# agent-tree.allium's ToggleVsSplitPaneInteraction), and both are real.
#
# The deeper home for this one check is `allium check`, which already parses
# every spec and knows every declared name, where this approximates with a
# word-occurrence grep. `allium` is an externally installed binary, so that is
# out of reach here; noted so nobody re-derives it if the repo ever vendors it.
#
# Scanned surfaces (or the explicit paths given as arguments):
#   - CLAUDE.md and the topic files under docs/ that CLAUDE.md points at
#   - docs/specs/*.allium
#   - plugin/skills/*/SKILL.md — agent-facing skill copy
#   - src/**/*.rs doc comments (`///`, `//!`) — where #3806's phantom lived
#
# Deliberately NOT scanned:
#   - docs/plans/, docs/superpowers/, docs/research/ — dated working artifacts
#     that legitimately describe code as it stood then
#   - SHORT bare snake_case tokens (under four underscores). Scanning every bare
#     token would catch #3806's dispatch.allium phantom, but measured 37 hits
#     for 1 real finding — a 97% false-positive rate. A checker that cries wolf
#     gets bypassed. #4097 recovered most of the value by raising the bar to
#     four underscores, which is where the corpus goes quiet; see the `bare`
#     note below and docs/plans/archive/2026-07-31-3807-check-doc-symbols.md.
#   - bare PascalCase with no `::` and no owning file. Allium block names
#     (EpicStatusRecalculation, WorktreeReleaseIsGated, …) live only in `--`
#     prose and are indistinguishable from type names: ~60 hits, 0 real
#     findings. The same names ARE checked once a citation says which spec owns
#     them — that is the specsym shape below.
#   - markdown fenced code blocks are NOT exempt. docs/mcp.md's flow diagram
#     sits in a fence and held a real rot, so fences are scanned like prose; a
#     fence quoting foreign code needs the marker below.
#
# Escape hatch: an `allow-phantom-symbol: <why>` comment on the offending line
# or the line directly above it, mirroring `allow-test-sleep:` in
# check-no-test-sleep.sh. Use it for deliberate references to removed code, to
# external-crate names, and to a skill's own self-managed local-state schema
# (field names that exist only in that skill's prose, describing a state file
# the skill itself reads/writes — e.g. allium-loop's `.claude/allium-loop-
# state.local.md` fields, #4195). That last case is a real false-positive
# class, not staleness: the fields have no backing Rust/Allium declaration to
# validate against, so indexing plugin/skills/*.md as a source would just
# make every phantom self-validate through its own prose (see the identifier-
# index note above).
#
# Behaviour is pinned by scripts/test-check-doc-symbols.sh.
# Run from the repo root. Exits non-zero if anything is stale.

# pathsym — `src/feed/cycle.rs::FeedCycle::run`. Checked against the CITED FILE,

#   survived two commits.
# typesym — `FeedJob::run`. Every segment must occur somewhere in the code.
#   Bare PascalCase with no `::` is deliberately NOT a shape: Allium block names
#   (`EpicStatusRecalculation`, `WorktreeReleaseIsGated`, …) live only in `--`

# bare — a snake_case name with at least FOUR underscores. The threshold is a
#   measurement: across docs/specs/ it is the lowest value with zero false
#   positives (at three, `repo_group_epic_id` trips it; at one, 34 tokens do).
#   Long names are overwhelmingly test-function citations, which is the #3989
#   rot — a deleted test kept its name in a `@guidance` block for four reviews.
# specsym — `agent-tree.allium's AgentTreeGitQuery`. Only the possessive form
#   is a shape. Across the corpus it is the idiom for a cross-spec citation and
#   carries no noise, whereas `<file>.allium <Word>` matches ordinary sentences
#   ("see feeds.allium — Both queries …") and would need a stopword list.
# Double-quoted, unlike its four siblings: the pattern contains an apostrophe.
# Normalising it to single quotes to match them breaks the shape SILENTLY — the
