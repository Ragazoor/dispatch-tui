# Verify every `src/…` and `docs/…` path mentioned in our agent-facing docs
# actually exists, and that every `file:NN` line citation is in range. By
# default scans README.md and CLAUDE.md plus every docs/*.md and
# docs/specs/*.allium. The globs are deliberately non-recursive, which
# excludes docs/plans/,
# docs/superpowers/, and docs/research/ — those are dated artifacts, so a
# reference that has since gone stale is expected, not a defect. Pass an
# explicit path to scan a single file instead.
#
# What is validated, per reference:
#   - plain paths (`src/store/mod.rs`, `docs/conventions.md`, `docs/specs/x.allium`)
#   - directory references written with a trailing slash (`src/tui/ui/kanban/`)
#   - brace lists (`src/store/queries/{tasks,epics}.rs`) — every member is checked
#   - line citations (`src/store/mod.rs:30`, `src/store/mod.rs:30-42`) — the file must
#     have at least that many lines
#
# Behaviour is pinned by scripts/test-check-doc-paths.sh.
# Run from the repo root. Exits non-zero if anything is stale.
