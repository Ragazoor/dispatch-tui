#   - a PR matched by two queries collapses to ONE item carrying BOTH signals

#     tag "dependabot" (no longer excluded)
#   - only a bot listed in bots.conf earns tag "dependabot"; another bot's PR
#     (a release bot) is included with tag "pr-review"
#   - an absent bots.conf falls the tag back to the "[bot]" login suffix
#   - a PR authored by the gh user carries the author-me signal
#   - draft PRs are included, with a "draft" label; non-draft PRs get no such
#     label
#   - the output parses as a JSON array
#   - a PR matched ONLY by an org-scoped review query (via org.conf) carries
#     the org-review signal
#   - a bot PR matched ONLY by the bot-author pass (via bots.conf) carries
#     author-bot and nothing else, so route() sends it to Bots
#   - a bot PR matched by BOTH the bot-author pass and a review query merges
#     into one item carrying both signals (engagement precedence preserved)
#   - the bot-author pass is capped PER REPO: one query per (repo x author),
#     with --limit 20 --sort created --order desc
#   - the bot-author pass is skipped entirely when bots.conf is absent
