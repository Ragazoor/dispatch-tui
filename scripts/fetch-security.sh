# Fetch open Dependabot vulnerability alerts for a list of GitHub repositories
# and output them as FeedItem JSON for use as a dispatch feed epic command.
#
# Requirements: gh (GitHub CLI, authenticated), jq
#
# Usage:
#   dispatch verify-feed scripts/fetch-security.sh   # validate output
#   # Or configure as feed_command on a feed epic with feed_interval_secs = 300
#
# Note: when used as a dispatch feed_command, use the absolute path to this
# script. Relative paths only work if dispatch is launched from the project root.
#
# To add/remove repos, edit the REPOS array below.

# NOTE: per_page=100 is the GitHub REST API maximum per request. Repos with
# more than 100 open Dependabot alerts will be silently truncated. This is
# acceptable for most projects; if you need full pagination use:
#   gh api --paginate "/repos/$repo/dependabot/alerts?state=open&per_page=100"
# (requires a different jq pipeline to flatten paginated responses).
