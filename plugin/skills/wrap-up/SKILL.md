name: wrap-up
description: Use to finish a dispatch task and close its session — whenever work in a dispatch worktree is complete and the user says to wrap up, finish, close out, finalise, or "we're done here", even if they don't name this skill. The user first chooses one of three paths: rebase onto the task's base_branch (dispatch-driven), author and open a draft GitHub PR yourself (you write the title and body), or done with no git operations. It then runs the retro, commits remaining changes, and runs the repo's verify command before any git operation touches a shared branch. Always use this rather than calling wrap_up/exit_session by hand — the path must be settled before the retro, the retro must run before the commit, and the two closing calls have an ordering that is easy to get wrong.

# Wrap Up

Wrap up a dispatch worktree. All three paths follow the same shape:

choose the action → `/retro` → commit → verify → `wrap_up(action)` → a single `exit_session(token, action, ...)` call that applies the terminal state change and closes the session.

**`exit_session` is mandatory on every path.** `wrap_up` alone changes nothing terminal — it issues a token and, for `rebase`, does the git work. The task's status is not moved and the session is not closed until `exit_session` runs. A wrap-up that stops after `wrap_up` leaves the tmux window alive and the task stuck in its old status. Never end your turn between the two calls.

- **rebase** — dispatch handles the git work. `wrap_up(action="rebase")` fast-forwards `{base_branch}`; the closing `exit_session` call then marks the task Done and kills your tmux window. On a successful rebase, dispatch also re-indexes the repo in the background if it has a RAG index.
- **pr** — you handle it. Inspect the diff you produced, write a real title and body that describe what was actually built, and run `gh pr create --draft` yourself. Dispatch deliberately does not author PR bodies: an auto-generated body is always worse than what you can write after seeing the work.
- **done** — no git operations. Use for research, planning, or work already on `{base_branch}`.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the wrap-up skill to complete this task."

## Argument check

If the skill was invoked with an argument (e.g. `/wrap-up rebase`, `/wrap-up pr`, or `/wrap-up done`):
- Treat the argument as the chosen action (`rebase`, `pr`, or `done`)
- Skip Step 4 (AskUserQuestion) entirely
- After completing Steps 1–3, go straight to Step 5 with that action (Step 4 is the only step skipped)

If the argument is anything other than `rebase`, `pr`, or `done`, ignore it and proceed normally (Step 4 will ask).

**Precondition:** The task must have a worktree and be in "running" or "review" status. This applies to all three paths — `wrap_up` validates it server-side (`is_wrappable`) and rejects anything else, so there is no path where you can wrap up a backlog task or one without a worktree.

## Step 1: Get the task ID from the current branch

Run:
```bash
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
```

Extract the leading integer from the `{id}-{slug}` pattern (e.g. `42-fix-login-bug` → `42`).

If the branch does not match the `{id}-{slug}` pattern, stop and tell the user:
> "This branch doesn't follow the dispatch naming convention (`{id}-{slug}`). Cannot determine task ID."

## Step 2: Get task details

Call the `dispatch` MCP tool `get_task` with the task ID from Step 1. The response is prose, one labelled line per field — read the values off the labels named below, and treat a missing line as the field being unset. Read `Base branch: <name>` and use that name wherever the instructions below refer to `{base_branch}`. If the line is absent or empty, fall back to `main`. (The rebase path resolves the real base branch server-side from the task record, so `{base_branch}` only matters for the diff/PR commands you run locally.)

Also read `Wrap-up mode: <mode>`. The line is printed only when a mode is set, so its presence is the signal. If it is there (`rebase`, `pr`, or `done`) **and** no argument was provided at invocation, treat it exactly like an argument: skip Step 4 (AskUserQuestion) and proceed to Step 5 with that action.

A preset mode is the user's answer, given earlier — not permission to skip the wrap-up itself. Everything from here is yours to run without further input from anyone: retro, commit, verify, `wrap_up`, `exit_session`. Do not stop to confirm the mode you just read, do not report that you are about to wrap up and wait, and do not end your turn anywhere before `exit_session` returns. This is worth stating plainly because the failure is silent and has happened twice: the agent suppressed the question, went idle at a blank prompt, and left the branch unmerged and the task stuck in `running` until a human noticed. A preset mode that only removes the question is strictly worse than no preset mode at all.

Also read `Verify command: <command>`, if present, and hold onto it for Step 7. If the line is absent, there is nothing to verify and Step 7 is a no-op.

## Step 3: Simplify code changes (conditional)

Check whether code was written in this branch — both committed and uncommitted:

```bash
git diff {base_branch}..HEAD --name-only
git diff --name-only
```

If the combined output includes any source code files (`.rs`, `.py`, `.ts`, `.js`, `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `.go`, `.java`, `.cpp`, `.c`, `.h`, `.swift`, `.kt`, `.rb`, `.cs`) — i.e., not only docs, configs, snapshots, or lock files — invoke the `simplify` skill to review and apply improvements:

```
Skill({ skill: "simplify" })
```

Wait for the skill to complete before proceeding. If it makes additional changes, those will be picked up in Step 6.

`simplify` ends by printing a summary of what it fixed and skipped. That summary
is not a stopping point — go straight on to Step 4 (or Step 5, if the action is
already settled) in the same turn. The warning above about not ending your turn
before `exit_session` applies here as much as anywhere, and this step is the
easiest place to forget it: a long cleanup pass followed by a written summary
reads like the end of a turn, and the calling skill has not even reached its
commit yet.

If there are no code file changes, skip this step entirely.

## Step 4: Ask the user to choose

Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool, and wait for an actual answer before going on.

This is the one genuinely irreversible decision in the whole skill, which is why it belongs to the user rather than to you. Rebase fast-forwards a shared branch; the PR path pushes a branch and opens a PR under the user's GitHub identity; done closes the task with the work integrated nowhere. Guessing wrong is not a slightly-suboptimal choice — it publishes something or discards an integration step, and there is no undo from inside this skill. Even when the work obviously "looks like a PR", the user may have a reason to rebase. Ask.

The exception is when the action was already chosen for you — an invocation argument or `wrap_up_mode` from Step 2. That is the user's answer, given earlier; don't ask again.

Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool with a question like:

> Wrap up task #{id} (`{title}`):
> **(r)** rebase onto `{base_branch}` — dispatch fast-forwards `{base_branch}` with this branch and kills this tmux window
> **(p)** author and create a draft PR — you draft the title/body, run `gh pr create`, then record the URL via `exit_session`
> **(d)** done — no git operations (use for research, planning, or work already on `{base_branch}`)
> **(Esc / n)** cancel

If the user cancels or says no, exit without calling any tool. Nothing has been
committed yet at this point, and the retro has not run — a cancel here leaves the
worktree exactly as you found it.

## Step 5: Run the retro

Invoke the retro skill:

```
Skill({ skill: "retro" })
```

Wait for it to complete before proceeding.

Retro reflects on where this session lost time and may fix small inaccuracies in
`CLAUDE.md`, a page under `docs/`, or a skill so the next agent dispatched here
does better. Two things about this position are deliberate:

- It runs **after the action is settled** (Step 4), so retro knows whether its
  fix can reach `{base_branch}` at all. Tell it the action you are wrapping up
  with. On `done` there is no rebase and no push, so a fix would be stranded in
  the worktree and retro should file a task instead of editing.
- It runs **before the commit** (Step 6), so anything it does fix is committed
  with the session's work and travels with the rebase or the PR.

Do not defer it to the closing sequence. After `wrap_up` the rebase path has
already fast-forwarded `{base_branch}`, so a later commit strands those fixes on
a branch nobody merges, and the PR path has already pushed.

Retro may also file follow-up tasks. That is expected — leave them alone.

## Step 6: Commit uncommitted changes

Run:
```bash
git status --porcelain
```

If there are no changes, skip to Step 7.

If there are changes, commit them inline — run these commands yourself rather than invoking a commit skill or delegating to another tool. A commit skill would re-derive context you already have and can pull in its own conventions; you just watched this work happen, so you can stage and describe it in three commands:

1. `git add` the relevant files (prefer named files over `git add -A`)
2. `git diff --cached` to review what's staged
3. `git commit -m "..."` with a short message summarizing the changes

Don't polish the message. This commit exists so no work is lost before the branch is integrated — on the rebase path it lands on `{base_branch}` among your earlier commits, and on the PR path the PR body is where the real explanation goes. Once committed, move straight to Step 7.

## Step 7: Run verification

If Step 2 did not show a `Verify command`, skip straight to Step 8 — there is nothing to run.

If it did, run that command in your worktree now, **before** calling `wrap_up`. This is what closes the gap where an agent only learns about verification after `wrap_up(action="rebase")` has already fast-forwarded `{base_branch}` — by running it here, you confirm the code is good before any git operation touches the shared branch, on all three paths.

If it passes, continue to Step 8.

If it fails, fix the issues, then go back to Step 6 to commit the fix, and re-run this step. Do not proceed to Step 8 — and do not call `wrap_up(action="rebase")` — with a failing verify command.

## Step 8: The closing sequence

Every path ends with the same three steps. Only Step B differs by action, plus the PR path's authoring work which happens *before* this sequence (see *The PR path* below). The task moves to "done" (rebase, done) or "review" (pr) automatically — don't set the status by hand.

Run the three back to back in one turn. Each is a tool call, not a milestone to report on: there is nothing here for the user to read or approve, and every pause is a chance to go idle with `base_branch` already fast-forwarded and the task still stuck in its old status.

**A. Rate retrieved knowledge.** See *Rate retrieved knowledge* below.

**B. Call `wrap_up`** with `task_id` (the integer from Step 1) and `action`. This returns an **Exit token** (a UUID string). It does not close the session and does not move the task's status — that all waits for Step C. What it does beyond issuing the token depends on the action:

| action | what `wrap_up` does | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `rebase` | blocks until the rebase completes and fast-forwards `{base_branch}` | can fail on conflict, or if the repo isn't on `{base_branch}` |
| `pr` | nothing — no `pr_url` here, it travels with `exit_session` | |
| `done` | nothing | |

If `wrap_up` returns an error, show the user the exact message and stop. Do not call `exit_session` — you have no valid token, and the task stays in its current status. For a rebase conflict, suggest resolution steps.

**C. Call `exit_session`** with `task_id`, `token` (from Step B), `action` (must match the action you passed to `wrap_up`), and `pr_url` on the pr path only. This single call applies the terminal state change, clears the tmux window, and consumes the token — atomically. There is no follow-up call; this closes the loop.

Do not stop between B and C. Skipping `exit_session` leaves the tmux window alive and the task stuck in its old status — and on the PR path, the PR unrecorded.

### Don't dispatch the epic's next subtask yourself

If the task belongs to an epic with auto-dispatch on, `exit_session` chains the next backlog subtask server-side. You do nothing. This is worth stating only because `dispatch_task` is a tool you can call, and firing it yourself around a close produces two agents on one epic — one of them branched from a base that predates your own commits. Leave the chaining alone, including when the close fails (below) and no chain happens.

### If `exit_session` errors

- `"has no active session"` — something else (a merge, a manual close) already tore the session down. Treat this as already wrapped up, not a failure. Do not retry, and on the PR path do not re-create the PR.
- An error naming a mismatched action — the token doesn't match the action you're closing with. Show the user the exact error rather than guessing which action was intended.
- Missing/empty `pr_url` (pr path) — pass the URL you captured.

### If `exit_session` succeeds but says the close did not take effect

`exit_session` can return a **successful** response that nevertheless reports the close did **not** happen: text saying the task could not be moved to its terminal status, that your tmux session is still alive, and that it needs closing by hand. This is deliberate rather than an error — the exit token is consumed before the terminal write is attempted, so an error response would strand you with no retry path. Read the response text; don't infer success from the absence of an error.

When you get it:
- **Do not retry** `exit_session` — the token is gone, so a retry only produces "call wrap_up first".
- **Do not** call `wrap_up` again for a fresh token.
- Tell the user plainly: the close failed, the task is still in its previous status, the tmux window is still alive, and it needs closing by hand from the TUI.
- Your session stays open. Nothing was torn down, so the user can attach to the window.
- On the PR path, the PR itself still exists — don't re-create it. Only the task's move to Review failed.

### Rate retrieved knowledge

When dispatch starts an agent, it injects relevant knowledge into the prompt under "## Validated knowledge for this task". You may also call `query_learnings` mid-task. Each surfacing is recorded as a retrieval, and the knowledge base learns which entries are useful from your ratings.

Rate via the `rate_learning` MCP tool at the moment you act on an entry, not here — see the `learnings` skill. This step is the backstop: for anything you acted on this task and have not yet rated, rate it now.

```
rate_learning(learning_id=<id>, task_id=<id>, verdict="helped")
```

- `verdict="helped"` — the entry was relevant and you applied it (upvotes it).
- `verdict="wrong"` — the entry was misleading, outdated, or contradicts current code (downvotes it; may go negative). There is no `needs_review` state or human curation step — if it's clearly wrong, delete it with `delete_learning` instead of just downvoting.

Only entries surfaced to you this task can be rated. There is no separate "unused" verdict — simply don't rate entries you didn't act on. `wrap_up` does not accept verdicts; rate through `rate_learning`.

## The PR path: author the PR before the closing sequence

You are creating a real PR with a title and body that reflect the actual work. Dispatch will not do this for you. Do all of the following *after* Step 7 (verification) but *before* Step 8, then run the closing sequence with `action="pr"` — verify before you push and open the PR, not after.

### Inspect what changed

```bash
git log {base_branch}..HEAD --oneline
git diff {base_branch}...HEAD --stat
git diff {base_branch}...HEAD
```

Read the output. Build a mental model of what shipped: which files changed and why, which behaviours were added/removed/fixed, what the user-visible effect is. If the diff is large, focus on the changes that matter for review (skip generated files, snapshot updates, formatting churn).

### Draft the title and body

**Title** — imperative mood, ≤72 characters, describes the change as a single action. Examples:
- `fix(auth): handle expired refresh tokens without 500ing`
- `feat(tui): add project filter to archive view`
- `refactor(db): split TaskPatch builder into smaller methods`

Avoid `wip:`, `task #N:`, or anything that just restates the task title. The title should be useful in `git log --oneline`.

**Body** — Markdown, `## Summary` grouping the changes under bold category labels — the same structure CodeRabbit's auto-generated PR summaries use. Only include the labels that apply:

- **Breaking Changes**
- **New Features**
- **Bug Fixes**
- **Refactor**
- **Performance**
- **Documentation**
- **Tests**
- **Chores**

```markdown
## Summary

- **Bug Fixes**
  - {user-visible change and why it matters, in plain language}
- **Documentation**
  - {user-visible change and why it matters}
```

Each bullet describes the user-visible change and why — never a function, class, file, or variable name. Skip a category entirely if nothing in the PR belongs to it; a one-line fix can have a single bullet under a single category — don't pad it out. If a PR breaks a public API or requires a migration, put that under **Breaking Changes** first, regardless of what else changed.

Do not add a `## Test plan` section unless the PR is dangerous or breaking (a migration, a change to auth, a change to billing) — omit it by default.

Do not reference the dispatch task — no task IDs, no "Implements #N" (GitHub auto-links `#N` to an unrelated issue/PR in this repo).

If the change has UI implications, add screenshots or a description of the visual effect under a `## Notes` section.

### Push and create the draft PR

Find the repo slug from the remote:

```bash
git remote get-url origin
```

The slug is the `owner/repo` portion (e.g. `git@github.com:Acme/dispatch.git` → `Acme/dispatch`).

Push the branch:

```bash
git push -u origin {branch}
```

If the push is rejected (non-fast-forward), STOP. Do not force-push without the user's explicit authorisation. Show them the error and ask how to proceed.

Create the PR. Use a HEREDOC for the body so newlines and Markdown survive shell quoting:

```bash
gh pr create --draft \
  --base {base_branch} \
  --head {owner}:{branch} \
  --repo {owner}/{repo} \
  --title "{your authored title}" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
{your authored body}
EOF
)"
```

`{owner}` is the first part of the repo slug. The `{owner}:{branch}` format is required so `gh` resolves the branch in the same repo as `--repo` (rather than your authenticated user's namespace).

`gh pr create` prints the PR URL on stdout. Capture it — it is the `pr_url` you pass to `exit_session` in Step C.

If `gh` reports `a pull request for branch '...' already exists`, parse the URL it returns and use that — the PR already exists and your job is just to record it.

### Then run the closing sequence

Go to Step 8 with `action="pr"`. The ordering matters: `wrap_up(action="pr")` deliberately doesn't move the task to Review or set the PR url — that's deferred to `exit_session`. Until `exit_session` runs, dispatch has no PR-merge polling armed for this task, so a merge can't tear the session down between the two calls. Don't reorder to "close first, then finish up".
