# Knowledge Base

Use this skill to interact with the shared knowledge base — recording new entries and rating entries that were surfaced to you.

To *query* the knowledge base mid-task, call `query_learnings` directly, describing what you are working on in `query`. Do that when anything is unclear — before guessing or asking.

Reach for `tag_filter` only when you already know the tag you want. It is a soft score boost rather than a hard filter, so a tag you guessed at does not narrow the search — it demotes everything else until `limit` drops it, and you never learn what you missed.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the learnings skill to interact with the knowledge base."

## Rating entries you acted on

When you act on a knowledge base entry that was surfaced to you (injected into your prompt or returned by `query_learnings`), give feedback right away:
```
rate_learning(learning_id=<id>, task_id=<your task id>, verdict="helped")
```

- `verdict="helped"` — the entry applied and was useful (upvotes it).
- `verdict="wrong"` — the entry misled you or is inaccurate (downvotes it; may go negative). Neither verdict changes the entry's status — there is no human review step. If it's clearly wrong rather than just unhelpful, delete it instead (see below).

Do this at the moment you act on it, not deferred to wrap-up. You can only rate entries that were surfaced to you this task.

**Rate `helped` when:** an entry saved you from a pitfall, matched a convention you applied, or guided a decision you made.

**Rate `wrong` when:** an entry was misleading or no longer accurate.

**Don't rate:** entries you read but didn't act on.

## Recording new entries

Before finishing a task, ask: *Did I discover anything non-obvious that a future agent would benefit from knowing?*

### Ask this first

Before writing prose about code, answer one question:

> **Could you write a failing check for a violation, from the source alone, without knowing what the author meant?**

- **Yes** → it is a lint rule, and prose is the wrong home *anywhere*. Write the lint, the test, or the gate script. Record nothing.
- **No** → it is judgment. Prose is right. Carry on below.
- **Neither** — the finding is that the code is *shaped* wrong rather than that a rule exists → it is a smell. The fix is a refactor, not a sentence.

A knowledge base entry earns its place by carrying something a machine cannot check. If a machine can check it, make the machine check it.

### Record if:

- The user expressed a **preference** explicitly that isn't already in CLAUDE.md
- You built a **landscape understanding** of a codebase area worth sharing
- You found a **convention** that applies broadly but isn't visible from reading the code
- A specific **workflow pattern** solved a cross-repo or cross-task problem elegantly
- This epic or project has a **procedural step** every agent working here should follow

### Do NOT record:

- Code patterns readable from source code — the code is self-documenting
- Things already in CLAUDE.md, README, or existing docs
- Git history — visible via `git log` / `git blame`
- Debugging solutions where the fix is in the commit
- Things too specific to generalise — if it won't apply to other tasks, skip it
- How you fixed a specific problem — that's in the code and commit message
- **The name of the code that currently implements it.** An entry describes durable behaviour, a convention, or a domain fact. It does not name the **function**, **type**, **macro**, **fixture**, test, or **file** behind it. That includes a bare one: `TuiRuntime`, `handle_tick`, `make_task` and `in_memory_db()` are all out, not only `path.rs::symbol` and `Type::method`. <!-- allow-phantom-symbol: describes the citation shape itself, not a real reference -->

  **Why:** a refactor can invalidate a name at any moment, and nothing re-checks the knowledge base the way `check-doc-symbols.sh` re-checks docs on every push. A correct citation today goes stale forever with nobody noticing. A high upvote count does not exempt an entry — the rule is about rot, not about present usefulness.

  **What to do instead:** if the fact is worth stating precisely, put it in the Allium spec or a Rust doc comment. Both are gated and re-checked on every push. The knowledge base keeps the prose.

  **`record_learning` rejects only the shapes prose never produces** — a `::` citation, a call with empty parentheses, a macro invocation, a long snake_case name, a path into the tree, a source filename. A bare `TuiRuntime` or `handle_tick` passes the validator and still breaks the rule. Do not read a successful call as approval. A stable MCP tool name (`query_learnings`, `wrap_up`, ...) is fine — that is a public interface, not internal detail. So is a root manifest or a spec file (`Cargo.toml`, `package.json`, `feeds.allium`).

  Bad: "A step that must behave identically on both feed paths goes in `src/feed/cycle.rs::run_feed_cycle`." <!-- allow-phantom-symbol: the actual stale citation learning #401 carried -->
  Good: "Feed-cycle logic shared by the auto-poll and manual-refresh paths must live in one place, not be duplicated per caller — see feeds.allium."
- Generic language/library idioms that would apply to any codebase (e.g. "use an enum instead of a string sentinel," "clone the Arc once, not per branch") — if it's not tied to a specific type, module, or convention in *this* repo, it's not repo-scoped knowledge

### Picking a kind

| Kind | Use for |
|------|---------|
| `pitfall` | Silent failures, API traps, behaviour surprises — warn future agents |
| `convention` | Preferred patterns or style for this codebase |
| `preference` | Explicit user preference expressed during the task |
| `tool_recommendation` | Specific tool or library for a problem type |
| `procedural` | Step-by-step instructions that steer other agents (epic-level) |
| `landscape` | Codebase/system overviews — service maps, module responsibilities |

**A `procedural` entry must say where it stops.** It steers other agents, and an instruction that says what to do and never when to stop is not a guardrail. Its `detail` is required, and it must name the case where the agent should stop following the entry and ask a human. `record_learning` rejects a `procedural` entry with no `detail` at all; that the detail actually names a boundary is on you. No other kind needs this — a `pitfall` either bites or it doesn't.

Good: summary "Sync the repo before starting work." — detail "…Stop and ask a human when the sync reports a conflict you did not cause."

### Picking a scope

| Scope | Use when | `scope_ref` |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `user` | Personal workflow preference, applies to all work | omit |
| `repo` | Codebase-wide convention or landscape entry | omit (auto-derived) |
| `epic` | Shared design decision for this epic only | omit (auto-derived) |
| `task` | One-off note; not auto-injected into future prompts | omit (auto-derived) |

**Default to `repo` for code conventions and `user` for workflow preferences.**

### Writing a good summary

- **One sentence only.** If you need two, the entry is too broad — split or drop it.
- **Be specific about the behaviour, not about the code.** Not "be careful with DB queries" but "a task update that clears a field and one that leaves it untouched are different requests, and the update API distinguishes them — passing an empty value is not the same as passing nothing."
- **Lead with the actionable insight.** What should a future agent do differently?
- **Name no function, type, macro, fixture, test, or file** — see "Do NOT record" above. The validator will not catch most of them.

## Deleting stale entries

If a knowledge base entry is incorrect, outdated, or should be removed entirely, delete it:

```
delete_learning(learning_id=<id>)
```

This permanently removes the entry. Use `query_learnings` first to find the entry's ID if you only know its content.
