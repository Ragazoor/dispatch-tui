  Drive the Allium spec-first convergence loop (Loop A) from a spec or design
  document: dispatch a fresh agent each run to tend the spec, propagate tests,
  implement to green, and weed, repeating until converged. Use when a spec is
  written and the tend/propagate/implement/weed cycle is too large or too
  stubborn to run inline — many obligations, or a convergence that has already
  stalled once — and when the user asks to run the allium loop.

# Allium Spec-First Loop

This skill drives the Allium spec-first convergence loop (Loop A) from a design/spec document
toward converged spec, tests, and code. It is the spec-first sibling of `allium-weed-loop`. It is
language- and stack-agnostic: it never assumes a particular test runner or toolchain.

Unlike a ralph-loop-style skill, this skill does not rely on an external Stop hook or a
`.claude/ralph-loop.local.md` state file. The session that invokes this skill becomes the loop
**driver**: it dispatches one fresh subagent per iteration (via the Agent tool, never `fork` —
each iteration has no memory of prior ones, only the repo's own state carries over) and decides
whether to continue based on that subagent's final report. The driver never does the
rebase/tend/implement/verify/weed work itself.

## Instructions

### Kickoff

1. **Check for an existing active loop first.** Look for `.claude/allium-loop-state.local.md`
   with `active: true`. If found, read it and tell the user a loop is already active, including its
   current progress (`started_at`, and `runs_completed` of `max_iterations`). <!-- allow-phantom-symbol: allium-loop's own state-file field, schema declared only in this skill's prose -->
   Then use AskUserQuestion to ask whether to:
   - **Resume** — dispatch the next iteration using the existing file's values (do not reset
     `runs_completed`, `retry_count`, or `consecutive_no_change_runs`). <!-- allow-phantom-symbol: allium-loop's own state-file field, schema declared only in this skill's prose -->
   - **Abandon** — delete the state file and continue with a fresh kickoff below.
   - **Cancel** — stop here, do nothing further.

   Never silently overwrite an active state file.

2. **Resolve the input design/spec document**, in priority order:
   1. **Explicit arg** — if a path was passed to the skill, use it.
   2. **Recent context** — otherwise scan the recent conversation for a design/spec document
      created or referenced this session (e.g. an Allium spec just written or extended under
      `docs/specs/`, or a file under `docs/superpowers/specs/` or `docs/plans/`, or a path the
      user just named). An `.allium` file is a first-class input here, not a fallback: in a repo
      that keeps Allium specs the dispatch prompt's own design step produces one, and handing the
      loop that spec is the normal way a dispatched agent enters it. In a repo that keeps none,
      the design step is brainstorming instead, so expect a `docs/plans/` doc here rather than a
      spec. If exactly one clear candidate exists, use it and
      **tell the user which document was picked** so they can catch a wrong guess.
   3. **Ask** — if args and context yield nothing, or multiple candidates are ambiguous, ask for
      the doc path via AskUserQuestion.

3. **Resolve the verify command** for this repo — the command that runs its test suite (and any
   other required checks) — in priority order:
   1. **Task/session context** — a verify command already surfaced this session (e.g. one
      the user named, or one recorded for this repo via a project's task-management
      tooling).
   2. **Project docs** — a documented test/build command in this repo's `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
      `README`, or equivalent (e.g. `cargo test`, `npm test`, `pytest`, `go test ./...`,
      `mvn test`).
   3. **Ask** — if none is found, ask the user for the command via AskUserQuestion before
      starting the loop.

4. **Resolve the base branch** to rebase onto each iteration — in priority order:
   1. **Task context** — if this session is running as a dispatched task, use that task's
      `base_branch` (e.g. via the dispatch MCP `get_task` tool).
   2. **Ask** — if there is no task context to read a base branch from, ask the user via
      AskUserQuestion rather than assuming `main`.

5. **Resolve `max_iterations`**: if the user explicitly asked for a specific value when invoking
   the skill (e.g. "run allium-loop with max_iterations 20"), use it; otherwise default to `6`.

6. **Resolve `model`** — the model each iteration agent runs on: if the user explicitly asked for
   one when invoking the skill (e.g. "run allium-loop on opus"), use it; otherwise default to
   `sonnet`. A run does up to `max_iterations` full iterations, so the iteration agent's model <!-- allow-phantom-symbol: allium-loop's own state-file field, schema declared only in this skill's prose -->
   multiplies across the whole loop; sonnet is the default because the iteration agent's own work
   (rebase, `/propagate`, red check, implement, verify, commit) is mechanical. The judgement-heavy
   spec steps are not affected — see the note in step 2 of the prompt file. Recording this as a
   loop parameter is what lets a hard convergence opt back into a stronger model without editing
   this skill.

7. **Read the prompt file** at
   `~/.claude/plugins/local/dispatch/skills/allium-loop/prompt.md`.

8. **Create the loop state file** directly at `.claude/allium-loop-state.local.md` using the
   Write tool:

```markdown
---
active: true
runs_completed: 0
max_iterations: MAX_ITERATIONS
retry_count: 0
consecutive_no_change_runs: 0
design_doc: "DESIGN_DOC_PATH"
base_branch: "BASE_BRANCH"
verify_command: "VERIFY_COMMAND"
model: "MODEL"
started_at: "TIMESTAMP"
---
```

   Get the timestamp with `date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ`.

9. **Tell the user** the loop is active (naming the design doc, verify command, base branch,
   `model`, and `max_iterations` — noting both can be changed by asking), then dispatch iteration 1 <!-- allow-phantom-symbol: allium-loop's own state-file field, schema declared only in this skill's prose -->
   immediately (see "Each Iteration" below).

### Each Iteration

1. Substitute `{{DESIGN_DOC}}`, `{{VERIFY_COMMAND}}`, `{{BASE_BRANCH}}`, and
   `{{ITERATION_NUMBER}}` into the prompt content read in kickoff step 7. The iteration number is
   1-indexed and always derived from the state file as `runs_completed + 1` — so it is correct
   after a resume or a context compaction, not only on a clean run.

2. Dispatch it: call the Agent tool with a **fresh subagent** (do not pass `subagent_type:
   "fork"`), passing `model` set to the state file's `model` value (`sonnet` unless this run
   resolved otherwise in kickoff step 6), and this filled-in prompt as its task.

   The two rules reinforce each other: a `fork` ignores the `model` override entirely and runs on
   the session model, so dispatching a fork would silently discard the pin — passing a fresh
   subagent is what makes the model override take effect at all. Read `model` from the state file
   rather than remembering it, for the same reason the iteration number is derived there: a resume
   or a context compaction must not lose it.

3. When the iteration's result arrives (a task-notification, possibly in a later turn), read `references/handling-results.md` and follow it: it covers the one retry on an errored or unparseable report, the progress bookkeeping in the state file, and the converged, stop and continue outcomes. Never emit a false convergence claim to exit early.
