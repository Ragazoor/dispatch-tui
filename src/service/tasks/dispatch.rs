//! The single dispatch orchestration seam.
//!
//! `claim → prepare inputs → pick the agent for the mode → provision on the
//! blocking pool → record where the agent landed → release the claim on
//! failure` used to be written out once per entry point (the MCP
//! `dispatch_task` handler, the epic auto-dispatch chain, and the TUI runtime),
//! with the `DispatchMode` match duplicated on top of that. `DispatchClaimExclusive`
//! (`docs/specs/dispatch.allium`) is the most safety-critical rule in the
//! system and it is exactly the part those copies each re-asserted separately,
//! so it lives here once.
//!
//! Callers keep only what is genuinely theirs: how they came by the task, and
//! how they report the outcome (a JSON-RPC response, a board message).
