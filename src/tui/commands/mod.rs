//! Per-domain command inner enums.
//!
//! Each module here owns one domain's side-effect commands. The outer
//! [`crate::tui::types::Command`] enum is a pure router over them — every one
//! of its variants wraps an inner enum from this module, with no inline
//! payload of its own. Keep it that way: a new side effect belongs on an
//! existing inner enum, or in a new module here, never inline in `types.rs`.
