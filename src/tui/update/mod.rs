//! Per-domain `Message` handlers, organised by area of concern.
//!
//! `App::update()` (in `crate::tui`) is the single entry point for all
//! `Message` dispatch. The handler bodies live in this module split by
//! domain (PR flow, epics, repo filters, etc.) so each file stays small
//! enough to navigate quickly.
