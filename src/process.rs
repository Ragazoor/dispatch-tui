///    running (`exec 1>&-; …`, or a wrapper whose last stage exits while a
///    sibling holds the pipe) would otherwise slip past the first bound into an

/// 2. **Output-pipe deadlock.** Stdout and stderr are drained on background
///    threads, so a child writing more than the pipe buffer holds never blocks
///    on us. Waiting on stdout's EOF rather than polling for exit also means a
///    child that finishes early is noticed immediately — this runs on Claude
///    Code's statusline debounce, where a poll interval would be visible latency.
/// 3. **Bidirectional-pipe deadlock.** With `stdin` present, writing all of it
///    before draining stdout deadlocks against a child that echoes as it reads
///    (`cat`, `tee`, `jq .`) once the payload exceeds the pipe buffer (~64 KiB on
///    Linux): the child blocks on its full, undrained stdout while we block
///    writing to its full, undrained stdin. The payload is written from its own
///    thread, which also owns the pipe — so it closes, and the child sees EOF,
///    when the write finishes. A child that never reads stdin merely gives that
