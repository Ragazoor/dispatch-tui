/// process those panes were created to run.
///
/// # Why the correction is not `send-keys`
///
/// It used to be — `cd <dir>` + Enter typed at the new pane — and that is only

/// it opened. See `SplitDirectoryIsNeverKeystrokes` in the same spec.

///
/// The target is mandatory, not decorative. `run-shell -bC` loses the enclosing

    // Every helper that takes a window *name* resolves it to a pane ID first, so
    // these tests declare the fake server's windows with `with_windows` and
    // assert the resolved `-t %N` target via `pane_id_of`. `with_windows` answers
    // the lookup out of band, so response queues and `calls[N]` indices stay
    // about the operation — see `MockProcessRunner::with_windows`.

    // What these tests can and cannot do: they assert the argv we hand tmux, not
    // what tmux does with it. The pre-fix versions pinned the vulnerable
    // `-t task-42` argv and stayed green throughout. The behavioural coverage —
    // that an absent name cannot reach a prefix-matched sibling — is in
    // tests/tmux_window_targets.rs, against a real server.
