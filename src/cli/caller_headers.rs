//! The `dispatch caller-headers` subcommand: Claude Code's `headersHelper` for
//! the dispatch MCP entry, installed by the startup configuration check
//! (see `docs/specs/startup.allium`).
//!
//! It has one answer — the non-dispatched-session identity — and reads nothing
//! to arrive at it: no arguments, no working directory, no database, no
//! network. Runs on every MCP session start and reconnect.
//!
//! # Why there is no second answer
//!
//! This used to derive a task identity by inspecting its own working directory
//! for a `.worktrees/<id>-<slug>` segment. That could never work: Claude Code
//! runs a user-global helper from its OWN configuration directory, not the
//! session's, so the directory inspected was never the agent's. Every
//! dispatched agent got `session` regardless, silently, and its MCP calls
//! carried no task identity at all.
//!
//! A dispatched agent's identity comes from its launch instead — see
//! `dispatch::caller_identity` and `AgentCarriesItsOwnCallerIdentity` in
//! docs/specs/dispatch.allium. The derivation is gone rather than left
//! unreachable so that only one mechanism answers "which task is this agent";
//! see `TheHelperAnswersSessionUnconditionally` in
//! docs/specs/mcp-task-tools.allium.
