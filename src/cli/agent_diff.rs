//! pane, showing the contents of whatever the tree has open (see

//! `RefreshAgentTreeDiff` rule).
//!
//! A separate process from the tree for the same reason the tree is a separate
//! process from the board: it is a separate tmux pane, and tmux moves the
//! cursor between panes itself. That is the whole reason the diff is a pane and

//! focus model, a focus indicator, a key to move between the two, and a rule
//! for which region each existing motion key acted on. See the spec's
//! `DiffPaneNavigationIsTmuxNavigation`.
//!
//! **This process never writes the open set.** It reads it, and the tree owns
//! it — see [`crate::agent_tree_open_set`] and the spec's
//! `DiffPaneHasNoToggleOfItsOwn`. Everything else it shows comes from git,
//! exactly as the tree's badges do: the paths come from the tree, the contents
