//! The diff pane's lifecycle as seen from the tree that owns it: split it when
//! something is open, kill it when nothing is (see
//! `docs/specs/agent-tree.allium`'s `SplitAgentTreeDiffPane` and
//! `CloseAgentTreeDiffPaneWhenEmpty`).
//!
//! Sibling of [`crate::agent_tree::model`], which owns tree *building*, and of
//! [`crate::agent_tree::diff_viewer`], which owns what the pane draws once it
//! exists. This
//! module owns only the tmux effect, so the renderer's key handling can stay a
//! pure function of the keys pressed.
//!
//! Replaces the editor pane this feature removed, and inherits its pane-role
//! marker, its focus rule and its accepted marker gap — the differences are
//! that the new pane subdivides the tree's own column instead of spanning the
//! window, and that it is killed rather than reused when it is no longer
//! wanted.
