//! One declaration of the subprocess call sequence a dispatch issues, for
//! [`MockProcessRunner`]-based tests.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! `dispatch_with_prompt` → `provision_worktree` → tmux launch issues a fixed
//! sequence of `git` / `gh` / `tmux` calls, and `MockProcessRunner` answers from
//! a positional queue. Before this module, every test that drove a dispatch
//! hand-wrote that queue as a `vec![ok(), ok(), …]` with a trailing comment per
//! entry, then asserted against hard-coded `calls[N]` indices. Three costs:
//!
//! - Six of the twelve steps are conditional, so the index of every later step
//!   depends on choices the test made earlier — which each site re-derived.
//! - Adding one preflight call meant splicing a response into ~45 vectors at the
//!   right offset and renumbering by hand. #3810 did exactly that and still left
//!   a stale entry behind, caught only because a reviewer counted calls manually.
//! - A stale entry is invisible: a spare `ok_with_stdout` is silently consumed by
//!   whatever call comes next, because most callers ignore stdout.
//!
//! A [`DispatchScript`] declares the *shape* once — which optional steps are
//! present, how the fetch goes, where the sequence stops — and derives both the
//! response queue and the call indices from that one declaration, so the two
//! cannot disagree.
//!
//! # Assertions get stronger, not weaker
//!
//! [`DispatchScript::index_of`] replaces a literal index with a named step, and
//! [`DispatchScript::assert_matches`] turns "this queue is the right sequence"
//! from a trailing comment into a checked claim: an extra, missing, reordered, or
//! stale call fails. Tests that pin exact argv keep doing so — this module only
//! decides *which* call to look at, never what to assert about it.
//!
//! # Finish is the same problem, one operation over
//!
//! [`DispatchScript::finish`] declares `finish_task`'s sequence (three preflight
//! reads → pull? → rebase → mid-rebase status? → abort? → fast-forward?) the
//! same way, for the same reason: four of its eight calls are conditional and
//! each preflight read gates everything after it, and the dirty-worktree
//! preflight landing is exactly the splice-into-every-vector episode described
//! above.
//!
//! # Response index == recorded-call index
//!
//! `MockProcessRunner` answers `tmux::window_target`'s name lookup out of band
//! (see `WindowLookup::AnyName`): it is neither taken from the queue nor
//! recorded. This module relies on that, so a script's Nth step really is
//! `recorded_calls()[N]`. A test using `with_queued_window_lookup` cannot use a
//! script.
