//! Named constants for the English-language substrings `finish.rs` and
//! `worktree.rs` pattern-match in git's stdout/stderr to detect outcomes git
//! does not otherwise expose in a locale- and version-stable way.
//!
//! Investigated whether a structural signal could replace these:
//! - `git rebase`'s exit code is **not** a reliable discriminator — a probe
//!   against git 2.54 showed both a real conflict and an unrelated failure
//!   (rebase refused due to a dirty worktree) exit with status 1.
//! - The presence of `.git/rebase-merge` (or `rebase-apply`) after a failed
//!   rebase *is* a reliable structural signal — it only exists once git has
//!   actually started rewriting commits — but reading it requires a
//!   filesystem check outside the `ProcessRunner` abstraction this module's
//!   callers are tested through (and, for a linked worktree, resolving the
//!   real per-worktree gitdir rather than `<worktree>/.git` directly). That's
//!   a bigger architectural change than this fix warrants, so the string
//!   match remains, centralised here instead of duplicated per call site.
