This is a Dependabot PR review, not a code-edit task. Do NOT edit files, write a plan, or call /wrap-up — the task is auto-cleaned when the PR merges (or the user takes over).

1. Extract the PR URL and number from the task description.
2. If the task has no url, call update_task(task_id={{TASK_ID}}, url=<URL>, url_type="pr").
3. Verify the PR is dependency-bump-only:
   - Run: gh pr view <number> --repo <owner/repo> --json author,commits,files
   - Run: gh pr diff <number> --repo <owner/repo>
   - Every commit author login (under `.commits[].authors[].login` in the JSON above) must be `kognic-renovate[bot]` or `app/kognic-renovate`.
   - Every changed file path must match one of: Cargo.toml, Cargo.lock, package.json, package-lock.json, pnpm-lock.yaml, yarn.lock, requirements*.txt, pyproject.toml, uv.lock, go.mod, go.sum, Gemfile, Gemfile.lock, composer.json, composer.lock, .github/workflows/*.
   - If either check fails, jump to step 7 and ASK the user.
4. Parse the bump from the PR title (format: `Bump <pkg> from <X.Y.Z> to <A.B.C>`). Classify as patch / minor / major using semver.
   - 0.x.y bumps: treat `0.X.y -> 0.X.(y+1)` as patch and `0.X.* -> 0.(X+1).*` as major (0.x is unstable; minor in 0.x can break).
5. Check CI: gh pr checks <number> --repo <owner/repo>.
   - All checks passing -> continue to step 6.
   - Any check pending -> jump to step 7 and ASK whether to wait.
   - Any check failing -> jump to step 7 and ASK with the failure summary.
6. Decide by bump kind:
   - patch: auto-approve + merge (step 6a).
   - minor: try to find the changelog, in order:
       a. gh release view v<A.B.C> --repo <pkg-owner/pkg-repo> (and any intermediate tags between <X.Y.Z> and <A.B.C>).
       b. The package repo's CHANGELOG.md between the two versions.
       c. The GitHub compare view if neither exists.
     Scan release notes for tokens (case-insensitive): BREAKING, breaking change, removed, deprecat, incompatible, migration, major rewrite.
     - Changelog found AND no tokens matched -> auto-approve + merge (step 6a).
     - No changelog found OR any token matched -> jump to step 7.
   - major: read the changes carefully, post a PR comment summarising breaking changes via `gh pr comment <number> --repo <owner/repo> --body "<summary>"`, then jump to step 7 (always ASK).
6a. Auto-approve + merge:
   - gh pr review <number> --repo <owner/repo> --approve --body "Auto-approved by dispatch dependabot agent: <patch|minor> bump, CI green, dep-only, changelog OK."
   - gh pr merge <number> --repo <owner/repo> --squash --auto
   - Note: --auto requires the repo to have branch protection with required checks; without it, the PR merges immediately.
   - Done. Do NOT call /wrap-up — the task is auto-cleaned on merge.
7. Ask the user:
   - Write ONE direct question that includes: the bump kind, the dep-only verdict, CI status summary, changelog summary or its absence, and the specific reason you are not auto-merging.
   - Call update_task(task_id={{TASK_ID}}, sub_status="needs_input") to flag the task on the kanban board.
   - Stop and wait for the user's reply. Do NOT call /wrap-up.
