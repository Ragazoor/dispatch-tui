//! Single-declaration MCP argument boundary.
//!
//! Adding a field to a task-shaped MCP tool used to mean editing three
//! independent places — the hand-written JSON input schema, the `Deserialize`
//! args struct, and a long run of `if let Some(x) = parsed.x` mapping blocks —
//! none of which the compiler cross-checked. `deny_unknown_fields` turned any
//! disagreement between the first two into a runtime `-32602` rather than a
//! build error.
//!
//! `mcp_args!` collapses those three into one field list, in the same spirit
//! as `mcp_tools!` (which generates the tool registry) and `service_api!`
//! (which generates the service seam). Each field is declared once and expands
//! to all three surfaces, so a field cannot exist in the struct and be missing
//! from the schema or the mapping.
//!
//! ## Field grammar
//!
//! ```text
//! <serde attributes>
//! required|optional <name>: <type> = [<mode>] { <json schema for this field> };
//! ```
//!
//! `required` lists the field in the schema's `"required"` array; `optional`
//! does not. The mode says how the field reaches the service params builder:
//!
//! | Mode | Expands to |
//! |---|---|
//! | `[manual]` | nothing — the handler consumes the field itself |
//! | `[set(m)]` | `if let Some(v) = self.f { params = params.m(v) }` |
//! | `[set(m, conv)]` | same, with `conv(v)` |
//! | `[set_some(m)]` | same, with `Some(v)` — for setters that take an `Option` |
//!
//! Every mode is conditional on the field being present, which is what makes
//! "absent = leave untouched" the default. A setter that takes an `Option` and
//! would be handed `None` for an absent field is a no-op on a params value that
//! already defaults that field to `None`, so there is no unconditional mode.
//!
//! `[manual]` is the deliberate escape hatch for fields whose mapping isn't a
//! single setter call (a pair of fields that validate together, or an id that
//! is consumed constructing the builder). A `manual` field still appears in the
//! struct, the schema, `FIELD_NAMES` and `MANUAL_FIELDS` — only the mapping is
//! the handler's job. `MANUAL_FIELDS` exists so a coverage test can derive its
//! own exclusion set rather than hand-keeping a list that drifts.
//!
//! ## Prerequisite: a builder-shaped params type
//!
//! Every mode emits `params = params.setter(…)`, so a tool can only adopt
//! `mcp_args!` if its service params type has chained setters. `UpdateTaskParams`
//! does; `UpdateEpicParams` and `CreateTaskParams` are plain structs built by
//! literal, so converting those tools needs either service-layer builders or a
//! new struct-literal mode first. That is a design step, not a one-line one —
//! don't budget for it as a rename.
