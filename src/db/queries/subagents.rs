//! `task_subagents` CRUD — the storage half of the live subagent count.
//!
//! Every operation rewrites `tasks.live_subagents` from the table in the same
//! transaction, so the denormalised count and its source cannot disagree.
//! The transaction is **explicit** and load-bearing: each Claude Code hook runs
//! in its own `dispatch` process with its own connection, so without it SQLite
//! would only serialise the individual statements and two hooks could interleave
//! their fence/mutate/count/update steps into a count that disagrees with the
//! table. Session fencing (evicting rows whose `session_id` differs from the
//! incoming one) is the drift bound; there is deliberately no TTL. See
//! `docs/specs/agent-health.allium`.
