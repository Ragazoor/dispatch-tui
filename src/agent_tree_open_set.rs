//! The one-way channel between the agent-tree companion pane and the diff pane
//! beneath it: which files' diffs the user has opened.
//!
//! The two are separate processes in separate tmux panes, so the set has to
//! reach the second one somehow. It goes in a file in the worktree's git
//! administrative directory — see [`crate::worktree_admin`] for why there, and
//! `OpenSetIsNotWorktreeState` in `docs/specs/agent-tree.allium` for what that
//! placement guarantees the user.
//!
//! **The tree writes, the diff pane reads, and never the other way round.**
//! That is what keeps the tree the single place a toggle is decided even though
//! two processes can see the file, and it is what makes the tree's row markers
//! unable to disagree with the pane below them (`NodeDiffOpenMatchesOpenSet`).
//!
//! Nothing here is durable state. The tree empties the set when it exits, so a
//! file left behind by a killed renderer describes nothing, and every read
//! soft-fails to "nothing is open" rather than erroring — a view of a git
//! query must not fail to draw because a scratch file was unreadable.
