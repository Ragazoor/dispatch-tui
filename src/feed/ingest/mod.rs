//! Feed ingestion: upsert an emission's items into the correct epic subtree.
//!
//! The pipeline has two independent sync strategies plus a shared entry type:
//!
//! - [`grouped`] — the `group_by_repo` path ([`grouped::sync_grouped_feed`]):
//!   group items by repo name into per-repo sub-epics.
//! - [`role_routed`] — the `reviews_parent` path
//!   ([`run_role_routed_feed_sync`]): route each PR to its role sub-epic with
//!   global `external_id` identity, moving cross-role tasks in place. Its phases
//!   live in [`routing`] (route/group), [`upsert`] (insert/update), and
//!   [`stale`] (delete absent tasks + clear the parent).
//!
//! [`FeedItemWithTarget`] is the shared entry — a feed item paired with its
//! resolved repo path and base branch — assembled once at the feed boundary.
//! [`run_feed_sync_by_role`] dispatches an emission to the right strategy.
