/// Subtree-scoped delete: removes merged/closed PRs from flat role sub-epics
/// and clears role sub-epics absent from this emission (moved tasks are in
/// the keep-set, so they are never deleted here), then a second pass at the
/// role level to cover repo-group grandchildren — always run, not only for
/// grouped roles, so orphaned repo-group tasks are cleaned up when
/// group_by_repo is off. The SQL is one level deep, so calling it with the
/// role sub-epic as root reaches its repo-group children — exactly the
/// grandchild level relative to the parent.
///
/// Returns every removed row that still owned a worktree or tmux window, from
/// the parent-rooted pass and all three role-rooted passes, for the caller to
/// tear down. A task MOVED this cycle is not among them: `apply_move` has
/// already rehomed it and its `external_id` is in `all_external_ids`.
