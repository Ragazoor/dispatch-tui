//! Per-epic single-flight claim for feed cycles.
//!
//! One [`FeedSyncGuard`] instance is shared by every surface that can start a
//! feed cycle — the auto-poll [`crate::feed::FeedRunner`] and the manual "r"
//! refresh in `src/runtime/epics.rs::exec_trigger_epic_feed`. Each cycle claims
//! its epic for the whole exec → parse → sync → teardown sequence; a request
//! that finds the epic already claimed is dropped. See feeds.allium
//! `SerialisedFeedCycle` for why the claim spans the exec and why the loser is
//! dropped rather than queued.
//!
//! **Both surfaces must hold the same `Arc`.** Two instances type-check and
//! silently serialise nothing.
