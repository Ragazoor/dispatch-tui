//! The one feed cycle, shared by both surfaces that can start one.
//!
//! A FEED CYCLE is the whole sequence a feed request performs for one epic:
//! claim the epic, read its current feed configuration, exec the command, parse
//! stdout, apply the degraded-emission guard, dispatch the sync, and tear down
//! the worktrees of every task the sync removed. [`FeedCycle::run`] owns all of
//! it; its two callers — [`crate::feed::FeedRunner`]'s auto-poll job and the
//! manual "r" refresh in `src/runtime/epics.rs::exec_trigger_epic_feed` —
//! differ only in how they present the [`FeedCycleOutcome`].
//!
//! That single-function discipline is deliberate and load-bearing: the feed
//! pipeline has repeatedly grown a step that had to behave identically on both
//! paths (the shared exec, the shared parse, the role dispatcher, the teardown,
//! and now the serialisation claim), and every time it was added twice it drifted.
//! A new step belongs here, not in the two callers.
//!
//! See feeds.allium `SerialisedFeedCycle`.
