//! Generates the dispatch-owned statusLine settings file that is injected into
//! every dispatch-spawned Claude session via `--settings`.
//!
//! The file lives at a path fixed at compile time
//! (`~/.claude/dispatch-statusline.json`), so the spawn constant in
//! `src/dispatch/prompts.rs` stays a `const` whose flags cannot go missing.
//! Runtime paths live inside this file instead, where they are quoted properly.
//! The name itself is not written here — it expands from `crate::claude_paths`,
//! the same token the spawn constant uses.
//!
//! Note it is NOT placed under the plugin dir: `remove_stale_files` deletes any
//! non-embedded file there. And it is NOT `~/.claude/settings.json`, which
//! `src/setup/mod.rs` deliberately never writes.
