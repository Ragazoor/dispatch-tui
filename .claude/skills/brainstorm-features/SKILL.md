# Brainstorm Features

Generate feature ideas for the Dispatch TUI by exploring the codebase from three perspectives — UX, DevX, and UI — then iterate on user-selected favorites and create backlog tasks.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Baseline Context

Read these files to understand current project state:
- `CLAUDE.md` — architecture, conventions, key files
- `TODOS.md` — known improvement areas

For detailed file pointers and stable domain context, consult `references/project-context.md`.

### Step 2: Spawn 3 Parallel Agents

Use the Agent tool to spawn 3 agents in a single message (parallel execution). Each agent explores the codebase from its category's perspective and returns a list of feature ideas.

**Each agent receives:**
- Instruction to read `CLAUDE.md` and `TODOS.md` for project context
- Its category name and description
- The specific source files to explore (listed below)
- Instruction to return exactly 3 ideas, ranked by value (impact on daily usage x feasibility), with a one-sentence justification for each ranking
- Each idea has: **Title**, **Problem** (what's missing or painful today), **Idea** (what the feature would do)
- Instruction to self-filter: explore broadly but only surface the highest-value ideas — prefer small changes that solve real pain over ambitious features
- Instruction that this is a research-only task — do not write any code or modify any files

**Agent prompts:**

#### UX Agent
```
Brainstorm UX feature ideas for the Dispatch TUI.

Read CLAUDE.md and TODOS.md for project context, then explore these files:
- src/tui/input.rs (keyboard handling, keybindings)
- src/tui/mod.rs (app state, input modes, message handlers)
- src/tui/types.rs (Message, Command, InputMode enums)
- src/editor.rs (external editor integration)

Focus on: keybindings, navigation, input modes, task creation flow, confirmation dialogs, discoverability, keyboard shortcuts, modal interactions.

Explore broadly, then self-filter to exactly 3 ideas ranked by value (impact on daily usage x feasibility). Prefer small changes that solve real pain over ambitious features. For each idea provide:
- **Title** — short name
- **Problem** — what's missing or painful today
- **Idea** — what the feature would do
- **Why this ranks here** — one sentence on impact x feasibility

Research only — do not write code or modify files.
```

#### DevX Agent
```
Brainstorm DevX feature ideas for the Dispatch TUI.

Read CLAUDE.md and TODOS.md for project context, then explore these files:
- src/dispatch.rs (agent dispatch, worktree creation, tmux)
- src/mcp/handlers.rs (MCP tool implementations)
- src/mcp/mod.rs (MCP server setup)
- src/runtime.rs (TUI main loop, command execution)
- src/plan.rs (plan file parsing)
- src/editor.rs (external editor integration)

Focus on: agent dispatch workflow, MCP tools, CLI integration, plan-to-task pipeline, developer productivity, agent monitoring, task lifecycle.

Explore broadly, then self-filter to exactly 3 ideas ranked by value (impact on daily usage x feasibility). Prefer small changes that solve real pain over ambitious features. For each idea provide:
- **Title** — short name
- **Problem** — what's missing or painful today
- **Idea** — what the feature would do
- **Why this ranks here** — one sentence on impact x feasibility

Research only — do not write code or modify files.
```

#### UI Agent
```
Brainstorm UI feature ideas for the Dispatch TUI.

Read CLAUDE.md and TODOS.md for project context, then explore these files:
- src/tui/ui.rs (Ratatui rendering, columns, detail panel, status bar)
- src/models.rs (Task, TaskStatus, Note structs)
- src/tui/types.rs (enums for display state)

Focus on: layout improvements, information density, visual hierarchy, task card content, column rendering, detail panel, status bar, color usage, responsive layout, progress indicators.

Explore broadly, then self-filter to exactly 3 ideas ranked by value (impact on daily usage x feasibility). Prefer small changes that solve real pain over ambitious features. For each idea provide:
- **Title** — short name
- **Problem** — what's missing or painful today
- **Idea** — what the feature would do
- **Why this ranks here** — one sentence on impact x feasibility

Research only — do not write code or modify files.
```

### Step 3: Collect & Present Batch

Present the 9 ideas (3 per category) as a compact ranked list. Each entry: **Title** — one-line summary. Group by category.

Ask the user: "Which ideas would you like to turn into backlog tasks? Pick by number, name, or say 'all'."

### Step 4: Refine Selected Ideas

For each idea the user selected, write a concise task description (title + 2-3 sentence description) suitable for a backlog task. Ask the user to confirm or adjust before creating. Keep it brief — don't over-ask clarifying questions. If anything is ambiguous, pick a sensible default and note it.

### Step 5: Create Backlog Tasks

For each approved idea, create a task in the backlog:

**Primary — MCP `create_task`:**
Use the `dispatch` MCP server tool `create_task` with:
- `title`: the feature title
- `description`: the refined description from Step 4
- `repo_path`: the current working directory (resolve to the main repo root, not a worktree)

**Fallback — CLI:**
If MCP is unavailable, run:
```bash
dispatch create "<title>" "<description>" --repo-path <repo-root>
```

Report the created task IDs to the user.

## Key Constraints

- Each agent explores independently — do not share context between category agents
- Ideas should be concrete and actionable, not vague wishes
- Task descriptions should be detailed enough that a developer unfamiliar with the codebase can understand the intent
- Repo path for task creation should point to the main repo root, not a worktree path
