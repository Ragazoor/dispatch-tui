#![allow(clippy::unwrap_used, clippy::expect_used)]
//! Real-tmux integration tests for **exact** window-name targeting in the
//! `tmux::` helpers (task #3798).
//!
//! # The defect these guard against
//!
//! tmux resolves a `-t <window-name>` target by exact match *and then by
//! prefix*. Dispatch names windows `task-<id>`, so with ids in the thousands one
//! task's window name is a prefix of another's (`task-378` / `task-3782`). The
//! realistic trigger is an operation on a task whose window has died — resume,
//! kill, jump — while a longer-named sibling is alive: tmux happily resolves the
//! absent name to the live sibling. The consequences are the wrong task's Claude
//! session being typed into, and the wrong task's window being killed.
//!
//! See the `TmuxWindowTargetedExactly` invariant in docs/specs/dispatch.allium.
//!
//! # Why this needs a real tmux server
//!
//! `MockProcessRunner` records argv, so a mock test can assert *"we handed tmux
//! this string"* but never *"tmux did what we meant"* — and the defect is purely
//! a matter of tmux's own target-resolution semantics. Every mock test in
//! src/tmux.rs pinned the vulnerable `-t task-42` argv and stayed green. Worse,
//! the obvious fix (tmux's `=name` exact-match sigil) is *rejected* by
//! `send-keys` and `set-option -w`, and `display-message` accepts it while
//! printing nothing and exiting zero — none of which a mock can see either. So
//! the assertions below are about observed effect: which window received the
//! keystrokes, which window is still alive.
//!
//! No test anywhere had two windows whose names were prefixes of each other
//! before this file; that absence is why the bug shipped.
//!
//! # Isolation
//!
//! Private `-L` socket per test with drop-guard teardown, from the shared rig in
//! tests/tmux_harness/mod.rs. Its siblings are tests/tmux_lifecycle.rs
//! (topology: which windows and panes exist) and tests/tmux_split_hook.rs
//! (routing: which pane a keystroke reached). This file's question is narrower
//! and prior to both: whether a named target resolves to the window it names.
