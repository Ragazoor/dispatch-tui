//! Parity guard: every gate script the pre-push hook runs must also run in CI.
//!
//! The pre-push hook only fires for a clone that has opted into
//! `core.hooksPath` (see CLAUDE.md's "First-time setup"), so a check that lives
//! *only* there is a check nothing enforces on a fresh clone or on a push that
//! used `--no-verify`. Three of the five gate scripts — the doc-symbol,
//! no-test-sleep and fetch-reviews checkers — sat in exactly that state until
//! #4221. This test makes the drift structural: add a script to the hook and CI
//! is required to run it too, without anyone remembering to say so.
//!
//! It also pins the two coverage-job properties #4221 fixed: tarpaulin runs
//! once (it used to run the whole suite twice, once for XML and once for the
//! stdout summary), and it enforces a floor rather than reporting a number
//! nobody reads.
