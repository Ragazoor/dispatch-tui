#![allow(dead_code, clippy::unwrap_used, clippy::expect_used)]
//! Shared rig for the real-tmux integration tests
//! (`tests/tmux_split_hook.rs`, `tests/tmux_lifecycle.rs`).
//!
//! # Why a real tmux server
//!
//! `MockProcessRunner` records argv, so a mock test can assert *"we handed tmux
//! this string"* but never *"tmux did what we meant"*. Task #3781 was a pure
//! tmux-targeting defect and its mock test pinned the broken command string
//! while staying green. Anything about **which pane** receives what, **which
//! cwd** a pane resolves, or **how many panes** a window ends up with needs a
//! real server.
//!
//! # Isolation
//!
//! Every test gets its own server on a unique `-L` socket, killed by a drop
//! guard so a panic cannot leak one, and the developer's own tmux is never
//! touched. Per-test servers also keep the tests parallel: they cannot share a
//! session, because they mutate session-global state (the active window, the
//! session-level hook, `pane-base-index`).
//!
//! Every call carries `-f /dev/null` so the developer's `~/.tmux.conf` cannot
//! change what these tests observe. Without it a local `pane-base-index`,
//! `default-command` or custom hook would make behaviour machine-dependent, and
//! CI (which has no config) would be exercising a different tmux than the
//! developer does. See [`SocketRunner::run`] for why it is on every call rather
//! than a single `start-server`.
//!
//! Each server also owns a pair of stub `claude` / `dispatch` binaries, named to
//! production through `ProcessRunner::agent_binaries` rather than shadowed on
//! `PATH` — see the "Stub binaries" section below.
//!
//! # Two observation styles
//!
//! * **Keystroke capture** — panes run `cat > log`, so anything typed into them
//!   lands in a file. Only possible for panes the test creates itself. This is
//!   how pane *routing* is observed (`tests/tmux_split_hook.rs`).
//! * **Execution** — panes run the real shell and launch stub `claude` /
//!   `dispatch` binaries that report their own cwd, pane and argv. This is how
//!   windows *production* creates are observed, since `tmux::new_window` starts
//!   the default shell and takes no command (`tests/tmux_lifecycle.rs`).

// the network and can hang on its trust prompt) or a real `dispatch` (which opens
// the developer's database).
//
// Do not go back to shadowing them on `PATH` (#3799). That needed four
// cooperating mechanisms and was still unsound: an `env::set_var("PATH", …)` that
// races libtest's parallel `Command::spawn`s, a pinned no-rc `default-command`
// because a pane's login shell re-resolves `PATH`, a `DISPATCH_DB` override to
// bound the damage, and two guards to detect failure — one of which existed
// because it had already failed. An absolute path is immune to `PATH` order.
//
// Still isolating *tmux* itself, unrelated to the binaries: `-f /dev/null` on
// every call and a private `-L` socket per test.
//
// One residual, deliberately left: panes run the developer's login shell, so an
// rc file that `cd`s would move a pane's cwd out from under the `pane_cwd` /
// `StubLine::cwd` assertions. Nothing about *which* binary runs depends on the
// shell any more. If it ever bites, `set-option -g default-command 'bash --norc
// --noprofile'` comes back as pane-determinism config — the same category as
