//! Regression guard for the tracked pre-push hook.
//!
//! The hook used to be a tracked `.githooks/pre-push` but was silently deleted
//! in a "save" commit (8be4b3ea), leaving only an untracked `.git/hooks/pre-push`
//! that new clones never received. This test asserts the canonical, version-
//! controlled hook exists, is executable, and runs the full check sequence — so
//! the same drift cannot recur unnoticed.
