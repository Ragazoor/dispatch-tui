#![allow(clippy::unwrap_used, clippy::expect_used)]
//! Real-tmux integration test for the two-tier mechanism that keeps new panes in
//! their agent's worktree: `split-window -c` for dispatch's own splits, and the
//! `after-split-window` correction hook for splits dispatch did not make
//! (`ensure_split_hook` / `set_window_dispatch_dir`).
//!
//! Every pane here runs a marked `cat >> log`, so this file observes three
//! things a mock cannot: the **directory** a pane resolves, whether a pane's
//! process was **restarted**, and whether anything was **typed** into it. The
//! last of those is a standing requirement, not a detail —
//! split-pane.allium's `SplitDirectoryIsNeverKeystrokes` invariant exists
//! because the previous mechanism typed `cd <worktree>` at whatever occupied the
//! pane, and the agent-tree companion pane exits on `q`.
//!
//! See `ensure_split_hook` in src/tmux.rs for why the hook needs an explicit
//! `-t #{pane_id}` target, and why the mechanism exists at all. Task #3781's
//! defect was purely a matter of tmux's own targeting semantics, and its mock
//! test asserted the broken hook string verbatim and stayed green throughout.
//!
//! Its sibling `tests/tmux_lifecycle.rs` covers the complementary question,
//! *topology*, on windows production creates. Why a real server is needed at all,
//! plus the shared rig: tests/tmux_harness/mod.rs.
