//! Regression guard for #4283: every reference feed script that emits GitHub
//! Dependabot vulnerability alerts (CVEs) must default `wrap_up_mode` to
//! `"pr"`. `fetch-cve.sh` got this in `8d9942f4 feat(feed): let feed items
//! declare wrap_up_mode; CVE feed defaults to pr`, but the commit only
//! touched that one script — `fetch-security.sh`, which hits the same `gh
//! api .../dependabot/alerts` endpoint, was left emitting items with no
//! `wrap_up_mode` at all. This test makes that drift structural: editing one
//! script's `wrap_up_mode` handling without the other now fails the suite.
